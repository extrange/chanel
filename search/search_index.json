Umbrella, hats, fans and sunscreen are essential equipments to get along with the hot sun. Campsite A was very noisy at night. However, it is also the only campsite that doesn't have light shining in in the morning. Multiple mosquito coils are required to ensure you don't get bitten. But you will still get bitten on the go. Actual water consumption for 2 people was about 4.5L, including washing. There is a functional shower at St John's Island toilet (25 minutes walk from Lazarus Island Beach) - perhaps bringing a bicycle would be more convenient. There are many flies and ants during cooking - may be good to do cooking at the pavilions available on the island. Butane gas lasts for very long, long enough to do a proper hotpot. Cooking hotpot in a small pot is not advisable due to the long cooking time. 1.2kg of meat is somewhat overkill for 4 people - perhaps 800g would have been just nice.","title":"9-10 Apr 2022 Lazarus Camping"},{"location":"posts/2022-04-09-lazarus-camping/#lazarus-camping-9-10-apr-2022","text":"","title":"Lazarus Camping 9-10 Apr 2022"},{"location":"posts/2022-04-09-lazarus-camping/#overall-notes","text":"Ferry tickets are negotiable.
