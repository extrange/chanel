Umbrella, hats, fans and sunscreen are essential equipments to get along with the hot sun. Campsite A was very noisy at night. However, it is also the only campsite that doesn't have light shining in in the morning. Multiple mosquito coils are required to ensure you don't get bitten. But you will still get bitten on the go. Actual water consumption for 2 people was about 4.5L, including washing. There is a functional shower at St John's Island toilet (25 minutes walk from Lazarus Island Beach) - perhaps bringing a bicycle would be more convenient. There are many flies and ants during cooking - may be good to do cooking at the pavilions available on the island. Butane gas lasts for very long, long enough to do a proper hotpot. Cooking hotpot in a small pot is not advisable due to the long cooking time. 1.2kg of meat is somewhat overkill for 4 people - perhaps 800g would have been just nice.","title":"9-10 Apr 2022 Lazarus Camping"},{"location":"posts/2022-04-09-lazarus-camping/#lazarus-camping-9-10-apr-2022","text":"","title":"Lazarus Camping 9-10 Apr 2022"},{"location":"posts/2022-04-09-lazarus-camping/#overall-notes","text":"Ferry tickets are negotiable.

We cooked dinner: Overnight in tent, where we saw the stars and Milky Way 9 May, Monday Begin trek back to hotel Unfortunately, route to Mt P\u00e9poiri was inaccesible due to snow, so we made a detour further to the east. We were offered a ride back to our hotel from the end of the trail by an elderly American couple, who asked if we were vaccinated against Covid, to which we answered in the affirmative. Nicholas took the offer for the ride, much to Chanel's distress. We checked-in and enjoyed a nice shower while cleaning equipment. 7.30pm: We had a EUR27 dinner with quiche, salad, mustard cream chicken with potatoes, local cheese, pancakes with strawberries (all cooked by the host Cyrill himself) Overnight in hotel 10 May, Tuesday We were planning to take bus 90 back to Nice, but our host Cyrill kindly gave us a lift all the way to the airport. We visited Old Nice and had lunch at a restaurant recommended by Cyrill. Chanel very kindly bought Nicholas a bar of soap. 6.40pm: Flight back to Singapore (LH1065 at NCE T1) Misc Accomodation Writeup We went in May 2022 for 2 nights of stay (and camping in the Mercantour National Park for 1 night in between). The host, Cyrill and his wife Stephanie were extremely cordial and welcoming. Cyrill gave us a lift from the La Colmiane bus stop (accesible via bus 90 from Nice). The views from the room were magnificent - the entire village below with the mountains as a backdrop. The night sky was very clear and we could see stars from the comfort of the warm room. We had dinner in the guesthouse (27 EUR) and it was cooked by Cyrill himself - the quiche was excellent. On the last day, Cyrill even offered to drop us back to the airport in Nice. The guesthouse is situated right at the start of the hike toward the Lacs des Millefonts. Overall, it was an extremely pleasant stay, and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly, in no small part due to the excellent hospitality of Cyrill and his wife. Future Improvements Get powder soups + bread for dipping Prefer dried noodles/rice/pasta for carbohydrates Toasted marshmallows are legit Bus Schedules Bus 90 schedule, in French Bus 90 schedule, English Total Cost Approximately SGD $300 per person, all-inclusive. A lot of the savings were due to not having to rent a car for the duration of the trip.","title":"7-10 May 2022 France (Nice) Hiking"},{"location":"posts/2022-05-france-nice-hiking/#france-nice-hiking-7-10-may-2022","text":"7 May, Saturday 4.50pm: Nicholas reached NCE T1 We walked to a nearby Carrefour City and bought: Dinner Hiking snacks: Noodles Canned meat Some 'pate' thing Baguettes Marshmallows Apple juice Water Camping fuel Lighter 6.30pm: Bus 90 from Grand Arenas to La Colmiane , 1hr 35min ( Google Maps Directions ) Overnight in hotel 8 May, Sunday Free breakfast at hotel Checkout, fill water Hiking route: Col de Veillos, Col du Barn, Mont P\u00e9poiri and Baus de la Frema (16.9km loop, .gpx file ) Detour to Lacs des Millefonts ( .gpx file ) Map of routes (Chanel) Other options (AllTrails) We pitched our campsite on a ridge after a harrowing scramble up rocks.
