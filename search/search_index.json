Overall notes: Campsite A was very noisy at night. However, it is also the only campsite that doesn't have light shining in in the morning. Multiple mosquito coils are required to ensure you don't get bitten. Butane gas lasts for very long, long enough to do a proper hotpot. 1.2kg of meat is somewhat overkill for 4 people - perhaps 800g would have been just nice. Actual water consumption for 2 people was about 4.5L, including washing. There is a functional shower at St John's Island toilet.","title":"9-10 Apr 2022 Lazarus Camping"},{"location":"posts/2022-04-09-lazarus-camping/#lazarus-camping-9-10-apr-2022","text":"View the Googledoc here .
