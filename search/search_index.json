This was just the beginning, he thought, as he settled into some good night's rest.</p> <p>He found himself floating in space. As he floated and crossed into a transparent field, he felt an odd sensation that his body has enter into a different territory and woke up.</p> <p>He picked up his new samsung M22 which woke him up to check the time.</p> <p>\"WELCOME TO XENON EARTH ZONE 5492\" greeted him on his phone screen. He looked around him and realised that he was not the only one who received the odd message.</p> <p>It was 1pm and the 9 men shuffled to the ship deck. Instead of the standard blue, they met violet tinted skies and seas. The originally yellow lamp is now burning a bright violet.</p> <p>The captain of the ship arrived with a circular black metal looking device floating behind him.</p> <p>\"As you all have noticed, we are in Xenon Earth Zone 5492. Here, we have been blessed with Xenon particles - the violet hue in the atmosphere. They were first discovered in 2000s and we have been researching them since.</p> <p>As you are exposed to the xenon particles, your mind and body will be able to think and work at superior levels. This has resulted in technology advancing at a much faster pace here than the rest of the world.</p> <p>To demonstrate, AI Jemma will give you a tour of the ship and test your body's acclimatisation to the xenon environment.\"</p> <p>The circular device glowed purple and begin to speak.</p> <p>\"This is the flight deck, where we launch robotic probes to test the atmosphere.\"</p> <p>Looks like an Amazon Echo, Nicholas thought. Also why would Xenon, a noble, unreactive element, affect our thoughts?</p> <p>Nicholas walked to the edge of the ship and looked at the water, tinted a deep violet by the sunset. The sea seemed to stretch into infinity; there was nothing but water, water and more water.</p> <p>\"We will now begin the acclimatization test. The deck will be negatively charged, initiating fusion of Xenon-331 nanoparticles with the human epidermis. You might get a mild tingling sensation - please be assured this is normal\".</p> <p>At first nothing happened. The sea breeze seemed to stay the same, the crashing of the waves against the ship continued. The air seemed to shimmer a bit - was this a product of the imagination?</p> <p>Nicholas began to feel a tingling in his leg, which gradually spread throughout his body, increasing further and further in intensity. Simultaneously, he began to think faster and faster, numbers and equations appearing of their own accord, his vision beginning to narrow further and further until his mind was consumed by a vast, inky darkness that seemed to span the Universe itself.</p>"},{"location":"story/#chapter-2-inappropriate-attraction","title":"Chapter 2: Inappropriate attraction","text":"<p>\"...I wouldn't be too worried.

She had a brief thought about quitting, but decided that her bond with the Department of Extrasolar Analysis and Defence wasn't worth paying off.</p> <p>The patient under her care stirred.</p> <p>\"Where am I?\"</p> <p>\"Oh great, you are awake. It is not everyday that we have a new recruit fainting from Xenon overdose.\"</p> <p>Chanel swiveled her chair to take a look at her patient. She already knew he had handsome face but still found herself captivated by his deep black eyes.</p> <p>\"We are at the clinic set up by the Department Extrasolar Analysis and Defence. Since you fainted, we will have to run an onmiscan to check if everything is okay before sending you back to the ship.\"</p> <p>She led him to the omniscanner and as she laid him down, she leaned in abit closer, taking in his warm skin.</p> <p>The machine started beeping slowly before suddenly ringing incessantly. The radiation chart readings touched the thresholds and then went off the limits of the monitor.</p> <p>How can that be possible?! It seems that his body has a high compatibility with the Xenon particles. We will have to keep him here and check him for a few more days, Chanel thought as she looked at Nicholas. He has pretty good features. When she touched his arms earlier, they were pretty well toned. His lips also looked soft and supple. It definitely would be a good idea to keep him here, she thought.</p> <p>Confused at why he was being stared at, Nicholas broke the silence.</p> <p>\"Am I okay?\"</p> <p>\"Oh! oh yeah yes, you will be fine! It seems like you are suited for life here given your body readings. Ill have to update the higher ups of your results. But before that, I'll be asking you some questions.\"</p> <p>Embarrassed, she started scribbling down notes on the patient's report and ran through the standard procedural questions.</p> <p>\"Now that is out of way. I am sure you have many questions of your own?\"</p> <p>\"Am I dead?\"</p> <p>\"Does this look like hell to you? No, nonono,\" the girl in the flowy black, lacy dress shook her head repeatedly and chuckled, her laughter tinkling in the air. Her short, neatly trimmed black hair blended in with the dress, making it seem as if she was wearing a full body suit. She was facing him expectantly with both hands on her lap, her manicured nails reflecting the sterile white lighting of the medical bay. \"You just experienced a mind jump. Ever had a time you thought you felt smart?\"</p> <p>Nicholas opened his mouth in reply, but the girl silenced him with another laugh, her dimples visible.</p> <p>\"My apologies, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Chanel, the chief scientist of the ship.\" She stood up and extended her hand. Her hands were tiny and soft, but she had a firm grip.</p> <p>\"Xenon microparticles are a relatively new discovery, so we don't fully know what they do. We do know that when exposed to electronic circuits, they allow much more computational capability, and we use them to build AI. Jemma is an example.\"</p> <p>\"We guessed that on humans it should be similar, and that's what we're seeing with mind jumps, which are the microparticles causing an individual to think at superhuman speeds. There are however other strange effects, which I'll leave for another day.\"</p> <p>\"If you're feeling better, I'd like to get you back on deck.\"</p> <p>She supported him as he sat up, and as her hair brushed his face he caught her scent, which reminded him of lavender flowers in a midsummer's field.</p> <p>Nicholas exited the clinic, his mind still active with questions. What was Xenon Earth, and why was he here? He recalled being on a ship, for some vague, overseas military exercise, and having a general feeling of dejectedness and boredom. He partly recalled having to wake up early and eat a grubby, high glycemic index breakfast, but yet now he was on a foreign ship and even planet altogether. And who was this lady at the clinic? She seemed familiar, yet so different...</p> <p>His thoughts were interrupted by the scene in front of him.</p>"},{"location":"story/#chapter-3-starry-starry-night","title":"Chapter 3: Starry starry night","text":"<p>Glittering amethyst petals fell from the sky like blooming cherry blossoms on a windy day.

It flew closer to the edge of the deck, toward a section without railings.</p> <p>\"Wait!\" Nicholas heard a familiar voice shout.</p> <p>A girl wearing a black dress in ran across the ship deck and grabbed Nicholas' hand and shoved a small red pill into it.</p> <p>\"I forgot to pass you this! It will help calm your nerves and ease your brand new active mind. It is also packed with bioactive peptides that will intensify your muscle protein synthesis which I thought...\"</p> <p>She paused to take a breath and looked up to meet his eyes. Smiling sheepishly, she continued.</p> <p>\"I thought.. would be something you'd like.\"</p> <p>Nicholas mused at the petite girl looking at him with such expectant eyes. At least a hundred possible replies crossed his mind but he could only come out with a thank you.</p> <p>\"Well, I won't hold you back any longer! Have fun on your mission and I'll see you in a bit!\"</p> <p>She looks like a small field mouse scurrying back to her nest on this violet snowy day. Nicholas rolled the pill in his hand before popping it into his mouth. It tasted slightly sweet.</p> <p>Feeling calmer from the effects of the pill, he settled into the dive capsule. Designed by ASPACEW, the capsule E22 was completely transparent and fitted with the latest navigation technology, capable of reaching depths of up to 55,800 feet and pressures of over 21,000 pounds per square inch.</p> <p>The engine whirred to life and capsule descended into the deep ocean.</p> <p>The first impression Nicholas got of the foreign sea was that of vastness. As soon as the capsule was lowered into the water, all 270 degrees of the entire spherical viewport were plunged into an unfathomable darkness. As his eyes adjusted, he began to see small, sparkling multicolored lights slowly descending. Some were violet, some purple, and after a while he realized them to be the petals he had seen on the surface, falling gently into the alien ocean. As each fell deeper, it began to dim, until it was consumed by the depths.</p> <p>As he descended, the light from the petals began to fade, until there was just a wall of dark, with only the blue glow of the communications panel remaining. He stared into the abyss, half expecting something to jump at him. But there was nothing. Just silence, and the quiet hum of the ion repulsion motors on board. He thought about the whole affair, the strangeness of the situation, how he was on a foreign planet, plucked out of his day programming job on Earth, for what was supposed to be a routine, boring military training exercise, and now tossed into what seemed like an alternate reality.</p> <p>His thoughts were interrupted by the communicator cackling to life. A chirpy female voice began speaking.</p> <p>\"Hello here, I'm Tricia, your executive officer or XO for short. I'll be assisting you through this mission.\"</p> <p>XO? Assistant? He wondered.</p> <p>\"Let's turn on the night vision first, um er lemme see...I think this should be it!\"</p> <p>He heard a click, and immediately the area in front of him brightened up considerably. He could make out towers of rock, with canyons stretching as far as the eye could see. At the foot of a rock formation he could make out what appeared to be shore with waves. Underwater? How was this possible?</p> <p>\"So I was told to take you this way, but that's boring, I hate rules y'know, so let's go somewhere more fun,\" she piped somewhat enthusiastically.</p> <p>\"My boss Chanel told me to guide you toward the left, that's where the previous expedition ended, but I heard rumors that the crew on the last craft that went to the right had some seriously strange things happen to them. Your choice!\"</p> <p>On the left, two towers of rock rose at a slant and met each other, forming a sort of gate. Beyond the gate, visibility was poor. On the right, a huge wall of rock blocked any passage, but there appeared to be a circular hole in the lower part of the formation, which seemed just large enough for the craft.</p> <p>Nicholas stared at both directions in turn, contemplating where to head next.</p> <p>It would be crazy to go left as Nicholas recalled the captain's last memo. On the other hand, there is no information on the right. He calculated the probabilities, evaluated the potential scenarios and reasoned with himself. The lure of the unknown pulled at his heart and one cannot deny a man's passion for adventure and his survival instincts.</p> <p>\"Let's go right.\"</p> <p>\"Right it is! I will send the exact coordinates to you now. Oh and don't worry, this craft is specially made to withdstand immense forces. \" Tricia piped through the speakers and three set of numbers appeared on the instrument panel.</p> <p>After accepting the new coordinates, a thin thread of blue light launched from the craft, leading him through the creak, lighting up the path and showing him the way.</p> <p>Nicholas held the wheel and steered it gently towards the right. The auto mode disengaged immediately and he was now in full control of his fate.</p> <p>With surprising ease, he guided the craft through the narrow creak and followed the blue line. The information transfer earlier had imbued in him knowledge and skills that he never had before.</p> <p>A road of pale moody dull sand approached him endlessly. As time passed, the feeling of dread and regret creeped in. Is there an end in this? What is at the end of the thread? Perhaps it was not a good idea to go this way. He could be meeting the rest of the crew right now but he wanted to meet with singularity instead. Before he could rotate the craft, everything went red.</p> <p>\"WARNING! Fast approaching object!\"</p> <p>In three flashes, a green dot appeared on the radar screen and teleported itself from the edge to the center. Even with his enhanced senses, Nicholas could not react.</p> <p>Directly in front, an E22 capsule drifted toward them. The capsule looked derelict, with deep gashes across the glass surface, disfiguring the ASPACEW logo. The entire capsule was dark, and its headlights were turned off. The dead hunk of glass and metal enlarged as it approached on a collision course.</p> <p>To his surprise, instead of panicking, Nicholas felt a strange sense of calmness flowing over him. To die in every moment; that is life. Just to sit, that is all. Where did those thoughts come from? Was it the pill Chanel gave him?</p> <p>Instead of hitting the emergency force field generator as he was about to initially, Nicholas closed his eyes and breathed deeply, fully letting the tension of the present situation fill his mind, and observed it, without fear or craving. If this was how his life were to end, in an unknown sea, on a foreign planet, far away from anyone he knew...so be it. He opened his eyes seconds later, just before impact...</p> <p>The lifeless hulk of metal and glass surged forward, making contact with his capsule's glass bubbler. To his surprise, there was no crash, sound or impact. The entire capsule passed soundlessly through the glass. As the ghostly apparition continued through his body, he felt an icy chill run down his spine.</p> <p>The entire capsule remained silent for a few seconds, the hum of the ion drive gone.</p> <p>\"...static...Nicholas...contact...emergency...activate rescue vessels... unidentified object\"</p> <p>Tricia's voice crackled intermittently over the communications channel. Abruptly, the engines restarted, seemingly of their own accord. The craft continued forward, toward the circular hole in the rock wall in front.</p>"},{"location":"story/#chapter-5-things-are-not-what-they-seem","title":"Chapter 5: Things Are Not What They Seem","text":"<p>Back in the lab, Chanel concluded her latest experiment - The Effects of Xenon Microparticles on the Spotted Field Mouse.

Surrounded by high walls and being closed off at the top, the place gave Nicholas a feeling of security. He felt protected from all sides.</p> <p>The hum of engines died down, respecting the sacredness of this temple. A sense of serenity washed over Nicholas over and over again like the perpetual waves on the beach. He calmly inspected the area and noticed that the walls were inscribed with alien langauge.</p> <p>To realize pure mind in delusion is the immutable truth. For the Soto race, sand is treasure.

Apart from the headlamps of his craft, the only other source of illumination was the pale violet glow of the words on the walls. Soto race? Sand is treasure?</p> <p>Abruptly, the glowing words began to dim and fade. The walls of the cave became darker and darker, swallowing light hungrily, until even the craft's high wattage headlamps shone on pure darkness. He was completely alone in the void.</p> <p>After sitting in the quiet darkness for a few minutes, he became aware of a faint violet light above him. He looked up.</p> <p>The ceiling of the cave seemed to have disappeared. In its place he saw instead an intricate pattern of lines, slowly shifting. There were smaller patterns of concentric circles and dots seemingly scattered at random among the pattern of lines. With a flash of almost inhuman insight, surprising even himself, he realized that he was staring at a star map, but one of galactic proportions. The map slowly panned, and one pattern of three dots started glowing more intensely - he recognized that as the constellation Orion. As he continued looking, he was able to make out Cassiopeia, Bootes and Aquila.</p> <p>The immensity of the map astounded him, for he realized that the civilization must have mastered astronomy, space travel and possibly even warping in order to construct such a map.</p> <p>Just as he began to make out a familiar looking dot with 9 others orbiting it, the star map faded away. In its place, a caricature of a creature with a lizard-like tail and human features appeared, and at the same time he was filled with a vague uneasiness. This image flashed thrice before dissolving into blackness.</p> <p>The cave walls slowly materialized back. However, the words on the walls had changed.</p> <p>From sand we arise, And back to sand is our demise. Just to sit is all there is, But if you must stand, then realize this, Be careful of what seems familiar, Your friends may not be what they appear.</p> <p>As he pondered over the meaning of the alien poem, his eyes caught a dim ray of light to his side. The entrance to the cave had reappeared!</p> <p>He turned the craft and sped through the narrow tunnel, back to the desert of moody sand. Curiously, he half noticed webbed footprints in the sand, but did not pay any further attention to it.

The violet glow of the gems faded.</p> <p>In darkness, piles and piles of sand fell onto him, enveloping and paralyzing him. He summoned all his strength and strained every nerve to free himself but he was held in place. Frozen in stone, he waited. Like a grain of sand, he felt impalpable, insubstantial, insignificant. He kept on waiting until, he heard footsteps getting louder and louder.</p> <p>It was the sound of approaching footsteps!</p> <p>Nicholas was jolted wide awake. Grabbing his laser pistol, he crouched next to entrance, ready to defend himself against any incoming threat.</p> <p>In the silent darkness of the early morning, Chanel's watch beeped softly, pulling her from her soft, sweet dreamworld.</p> <p>\"Priority one distress signal received.

You must be feeling hungry, I brought fried chicken for you,\" she cooed.</p> <p>Her footsteps picked up pace, headed directly toward him. As his eyes acclimatized to the darkness, he could see a dim silhouette, about fifteen meters away. He opened his mouth to shout in reply, but at the last moment, a deep instinct in him got the better of him and he covered his mouth.</p> <p>Looking around, he saw above him was a narrow ledge, which he could just fit into. He quickly jumped into the ledge and hid himself.</p> <p>The silhouette became clearer and he saw a female figure walk toward him. From this distance, he recognized her as Chanel. She wasn't wearing the black dress he saw previously, however.</p> <p>Instead, she was wearing a tight, body hugging red tube top, which accentuated the curves of her hips and round buttocks. Her cleavage was much more prominent, the tightness of the tube top squeezing her round melons together. She carried a plastic bag in her right hand.</p> <p>\"Where are you? I don't like playing games, you know.\"</p> <p>Nicholas held his breath as she continued walking, until she was right below him. He took the opportunity to look at her closely. Her skin was shiny as if she had just taken a shower, but also completely bare, without any trace of hair. Her nails were manicured, shining red under the dim light of the cave.</p> <p>She continued walking, but abruptly stopped at where he was sitting previously, right below him. She seemed to be confused, or surprised, as she looked around.</p> <p>\"Aww, hiding? Don't want to come out and play with me? I know you've been looking at me,\" she said, while moving her hands seductively toward her hips.</p> <p>How did she know that?</p> <p>She looked around the cave, and then stopped. Almost mechanically, she slowly started tilting her head upward, right toward where he was hiding, right until she made direct eye contact with him.</p> <p>\"Found you!\"</p> <p>Nicholas shrieked in terror and jumped, as two black lifeless orbs that stood for the eyes of the creature in front of him stared into his soul. His gun clattered uselessly to the floor, out of his reach.</p> <p>Morphing into her true self, a sinister smile spread across her face, taking delight in seeing her frightened and helpless prey. She twisted her neck in the most horrifying manner and extended it to bring her head less than two centimeters from his.</p> <p>Nicholas saw his own reflection in her eyes, face terrified and somewhat aroused. At that moment, he realised felt more excitement than fear. The thrill of exorcism, a dance with the demon would be exhilarating. With a tinge of guilt, he awaited the embrace of the creature with bated breath.</p> <p>Soft lips met his. Her serpent tongue licked, tasted and explored his lips before finally slipping in. A disgusting sensation of salt and dread assaulted him and he immediately tried to push her away. But she forced herself in and deposited a round orb down his throat.</p> <p>Nicholas retched and tried to vomit out the orb as well as the taste of salt but it was to no avail. His vision grew fuzzy and he lost consciousness.</p> <p>\"A gift for you.\"</p> <p>She whispered before disappearing. She left no trace behind, not even the fried chicken she promised him.</p> <p>Nicholas woke up at the beach. Violet waves broke gently into white foam against the soft golden sand. Along the shore, a small ghost crab was struggling against the breeze. Realising that it was spotted, it quickly burrowed itself in the sand.

At this time of night it was usually quiet, but there was now a flurry of activity as the ship's crew prepared the diving capsule. She headed purposefully toward the well dock area, her feet scurrying hurriedly.</p> <p>\"I've ordered Jonathan, our midshipman man, to take the craft down. You can wait up here and monitor progress over the videolink,\" Jemma advised over her in-ear monitor.</p> <p>\"That will be unnecessary. Chanel will conduct the mission herself. Jonathan can be the XO Prepare for launch,\" she said, changing into a tight, body fitting wetsuit.</p> <p>The solitary craft sat in middle of the well dock, the ASPACEW logo slowly beginning to be covered by water as flooding began. Chanel lowered herself into the hatch, familiarizing herself with the controls. She thought back to the last time she had played a diving simulation with her friend - that was just last year, at a carnival in a park, on an old PC, and she beat him. She smiled with the recollection of that memory.</p> <p>Chanel expertly guided the craft through the alien formations underwater, tracing Nicholas' distress beacon to the cave system. The craft surfaced into a large underwater cavern with a small sand shore. A single passageway led deeper. Two pairs of footprints marked the way, one pair being of boots while the other was webbed like that of a duck's.</p> <p>She glanced at her wristwatch - the distress beacon was only fifty meters ahead. She stepped gingerly through the narrow passageway, her footsteps echoing off the walls and deeper down the cave. It was eerily quiet as she ventured deeper through the twists and turns, the sound of the waves outside was no longer audible after just a few meters into the passageway. The passageway itself was illuminated by a dull, violet glow from numerous glowing crystals on the walls.</p> <p>10 meters. She was getting close now. Glancing at the floor, she realized the webbed footprints had disappeared. Curiously, in their place were the stiletto marks of high heeled shoes.</p> <p>As she made a sharp right bend in front, she gasped and almost stopped in shock.</p> <p>Just a few meters from her, in a natural crevasse of the rock, was a humanoid figure in a seated position, the upper half leaning on the the cavern walls. Most of the body was covered in a fine, sticky white thread resembling a cocoon, with only the figure's head free.</p> <p>Nicholas! Chanel's motherly instincts shook her free from her shock and she went over to cooconed victim. She felt his pulse - it was still there, but weak. To her relief, he was still breathing, in slow, shallow breaths. She held his face in her hands and shook him.</p> <p>\"Nicholas? Nicholas? Wake up!\"</p> <p>His eyes remained closed, his head falling limply in her hands.</p> <p>No, no, no, it can't be! Why did he risk his life doing such a dangerous thing! Her eyes welled up with tears, and to her surprise, she leant on him, cradling his soft hair and feeling what was left of his bodily warmth.</p> <p>Despite her grief, she took out her penknife and began cutting him free, resolving to take him out of this forsaken cave, which was now becoming eerily colder.</p> <p>She felt drops of cold water dripping on her neck.</p> <p>\"Chanel, Chanel, Chanel.\" A distinctively familiar, yet reptilian sounding voice hissed from above her.</p> <p>Above her, on a ledge, her previous XO was crouched, a pair of webbed fingers holding the edge of the rock.

Don't bother, in a few hours he'll become one of us.\"</p> <p>\"What are you?\"</p> <p>\"Why, your successors, of course. It was a mistake of your kind to set foot on this planet. Humans are so easy to tempt, slaves of their desires. Nicholas fell so easily. Oh, I thought you might be interested to know - he gets really excited about you,\" her XO taunted her. \"And by the way, he tastes really nice,\" she smiled gloatingly, licking her lips.</p> <p>\"Just die!\" Chanel screamed, firing her laser pistol. The creature was surprisingly quick, dodging her shots, disappearing into the blackness of the cave ledge ahead.</p> <p>Chanel set back on freeing Nicholas, all the while keeping her ears pricked for any signs of the creature. She completed her task uninterrupted, and then began to drag him back to the craft.</p> <p>He was heavy! She exerted herself, panting as she dragged him by his arms.</p> <p>The craft was still waiting by the sandy shore of the cave. Glancing back, she saw just the dim violet lighting of the cave. No sign of the creature.

It bounced back gently before continuing its journey to the sky. Round metal domes placed at four corners of the perimeter generated a circular force field of supercharged plasma.</p> <p>She filled two bowls with piping hot nutritious soup and handed one to him.

Nicholas' eyes were closed, his breathing calm. If he was nervous, it wasn't apparent to her.</p> <p>The air smelled faintly of ozone as the scanner energized, firing a beam of neutrinos through his body. A blue glow filled the room as the holographic projector materialized a 3D translucent replica of his body a few inches above him.

There was no indication of anything wrong.</p> <p>In his mind, it was anything but quiet.</p> <p>He was standing by the railing of a canal, a familiar-looking one he recognized from childhood. It was in the middle of the afternoon. He was looking at the opposite bank when a hand tapped his shoulder.</p> <p>\"Help me,\" A middle aged man pleaded, clutching his chest and wheezing. His eyes were completely black, and so were the visible veins of his hand, resembling a black spiderweb.</p> <p>\"Please, mister, help me,\" Another person on his left tugged at his shirt, a middle aged lady, her eyes similarly black. Her breathing was punctuated with bouts of coughing.</p> <p>He saw relatives, his friends, all in similar plights, their bodies wracked with the same sickness. In the crowd of people he saw his medical school friends, his dragonboat teammates.</p> <p>\"Nicholas,\" a familiar voice rasped. He turned to face the owner.

The room was silent, and he was alone.

It was an hour already and the committee was still on the first item of the agenda.</p> <p>Her mind wandered off to Nicholas. She made an excuse to go to the restroom and left the officials, who were now proposing using Jemma to choose flowers.</p> <p>She walked down the starboard side of the ship, admiring the night time view of the Xenon petals falling. Directly in front, she could make out the silhouette of someone leaning on the railing, similarly looking at the sea.</p> <p>\"Nicholas?\"</p> <p>He turned to face her, his face still recognizable in the dim light.</p> <p>\"Oh, hi.\" He gave her a weak smile and turned back to looking at the sea.

Peering into the microscope's ocular lens, a splatter of reddish pills came into view. As she rotated the knob, the image grew larger. His red blood cells was mutated, transformed into an odd hourglass shape. She had never seen anything like this.</p> <p>Chanel spent hours burrowing her head into the microscope and studying journals that could explain the peculiar genetic mutation. However, it appears that the scientific knowledge available in this era will not be able to provide a definite answer to this phenomenon.</p> <p>At the verge of calling it a night, she suddenly recalled her ex-XO Tricia being sick and isolating herself in her room for 5 days, refusing to receive any treatment or examination after one of her deep dive missions. She must have undergone the same transformation! There must be some clue there!</p> <p>When the moon is in its full bloom, Chanel sneaked into one of the cabins along the narrow corridor. Tricia's cabin was empty. Her single-sized bed that occupied three quarters of the room was soaked wet by the waves intruding from the unclosed window. A small desk at the corner held a mirror, some cosmetics and her signature black nail polish. Below the desk, safe from the elements, laid a stack of documents and journals.</p> <p>She squatted down to examine the pile of papers. The looser sheets fluttered in the salty night breeze. A large, bold title was printed on the topmost sheet. 5KM in 10 Weeks - Results Guaranteed. The next few papers and journals were on a similar theme - Lose 10 Pounds in 10 Days, An Experimental Determination of the Relationship between Belly Fat and Perceived Facial Cuteness. Chanel absentmindedly put them aside without further thought, wondering what Tricia's obsession with weight loss was about, and why she was into such trashy material - being an XO on board such a mission demanded scientific rigor, and these articles were bottom of the barrel material.</p> <p>Quite satisfied that there were no clues to be found, she restored the stack of papers to their original position. Just as she was nearing completion, she accidentally knocked loose a journal in a critical position, making the entire pile of papers fall. She impatiently let out a sigh and prepared to redo the stack - but stared at something in the bottom of the pile.</p> <p>A rectangular hole had been cut haphazardly in the last few journals and papers, forming a recess of sorts. From the outside, it was invisible. No one would have suspected there to be anything hidden in the innocuous looking stack of papers. That explains the choice of titles, Chanel surmised.</p> <p>Inside this recess lay a pocket sized brown, leather notebook with worn edges. Beside the notebook was a small transparent crystal, with jagged edges, as if roughly cut from a larger piece. As she gazed at it, there seemed to be very faint, almost indistinguishable flashes of color within it - a tinge of red, which as she stared, slowly morphed to green.</p> <p>It was then she realized how quiet the cabin had become. The sound of the waves had stopped, and the room was deathly silent. It was as if someone had tuned out the whole world beyond the cabin. Even the sound of the wind blowing through the curtains had stopped. She could hear her own breathing beginning to quicken as a jolt of fear swept through her.</p> <p>She became painfully aware that she was alone, and unarmed.</p> <p>Clunk. Clunk. The sound seemed to be emanating from somewhere outside, below the cabin window. It sounded like a hard material, perhaps boots or shoes, banging against the cabin window. The cabin she was in was at least 20 meters above sea level, and there were no steps or ledges of any kind outside the ship hull.</p> <p>Clunk, clunk. The sound was getting closer. Ledges or not, whatever was out there was almost at the level of the window.</p> <p>Her heart was pounding as she snuck under the table and curled herself up, trying to force her tiny body into the narrow gap between the table legs and the pile of documents. The window was just above her, separated by the 5 or so centimeters of the table top.</p> <p>Just then, she heard the curtains move, and she knew it was not the wind.</p> <p>CLUNK!</p> <p></p> <p>A metal cube and its chain dropped to the floor in front of her. Chanel nearly squealed in fright but she managed to suppress her voice.</p> <p>Two slender legs appeared in her view. She clasped her sweaty palms closer over her mouth and held her breath. The momentary silence felt like an eternity as she prayed for the stranger to leave. Unfortunately, her faced paled when she heard the words that broke the silence.</p> <p>\"There seems to be a rat in my room.\"</p> <p>It was Tricia's voice. Slowly but surely, she approached the table and bent over to reveal her familiar smirking face to Chanel.</p> <p>\"My my my... why isn't it my boss Chanel?\"</p> <p>Tricia's black orbs scanned over to the messed up pile of journals and paper. She pursed her lips when she saw that her notebook and crystal was laid out in the open.</p> <p>As she spoke, she slithered her dripping wet body next to girl under the table, separating her from her treasures. Fully aware of her every movement, Chanel froze in fear.</p> <p>\"It seems that you have found out that I have obesophobia. You probably didn't know that I used to be obese.

The reflection of the rising moon glinted off the metal cube and chains.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you into something. I used to be so jealous of you. Yes, really! Don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t know. How you maintained your slim figure, while eating all that fried food on board the ship. I was so, so envious. Consumed by envy, a burning, fiery pit in me, destroying me bit by bit each day, like a cancer growing in me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut then, something happened. Call it a blessing, or opportunity, whatever. I was shown the way, given a gift. I saw true freedom, freedom from my desires, from my useless body. And I willingly gave my body to them, like a spare part. I dropped my weaknesses, my humanity, my fragility, and embraced unbounded freedom.\u201d</p> <p>Tricia rose up, causing water to trickle down her slender legs, which were covered in a hard, scaly exterior, almost reptilian in nature. She stepped toward Chanel, squatted in front of her, and stared at her.</p> <p>\u201cNow my child, join me. Free yourself from your humanity.\u201d</p> <p>She opened her mouth, and extended her forked tongue towards her. On the tip of her tongue was a small round orb, the size of a large grape. It had a soft, translucent exterior, almost jelly-like, and within it, swimming within its pod, was a pea-sized flat creature resembling a fluke.</p> <p>Chanel reeled back with disgust and fear. A worm inside her? No no no, she thought. Turning her head away, she pushed against Tricia with her arms, expecting resistance.</p> <p>To her surprise, Tricia retracted her tongue and swallowed the orb.</p> <p>\u201cDisgust. Fear. Just look at your body, controlling you like that. No matter. You will soon willingly join us, and ingest the host, like we have all done. Oh, you will not just accept it, you will be begging for it, craving for it, like the little slave girl you are. Already you are a slave to your emotions, and soon, your body will feed us, and join the greater union.\u201d</p> <p>What a bitch, thought Chanel, feeling an impulse to punch the creature in front of her. She clenched and flexed her knuckles, preparing to strike.</p> <p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t get to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Alas, she was too slow, her subtle movements noticed by Tricia. Tricia reached out with inhuman speed and closed her fingers around Chanel\u2019s neck, choking her with brute strength. Chanel\u2019s eyes began to water as she fought back and struggled to breath, attempting to pry the webbed fingers. Her strength was no match for that of the creature, however. As she struggled, her vision began to narrow and darken, as Tricia tightened her grip, cutting off the blood supply to the brain.</p> <p>I have to tell Nicholas, thought Chanel, as her consciousness began to fade. The last thing she saw was the metal cube, glowing white and floating in mid air.</p>"},{"location":"story/#chapter-18-there-are-worse-things-than-cancer","title":"Chapter 18: There are worse things than cancer","text":"<p>Wide awake and alone in his bunk, Nicholas let his mind wander freely.</p> <p>Where is everyone?

The cruiser had been in low orbit for the last 5 days. From her position on the bridge, the gentle curvature of the blue-green exoplanet was apparent, with a speckle of light emanating from one of the larger land masses, a solitary bright light in the otherwise dark side of the planet. This was the landing zone, lit up at night by fusion torches, themselves powered by portable QFGs - Quantum Field Generators, a smaller version of the drives which powered the very cruiser she was on. The developments in quantum tech in the 21st century had enabled humanity to tap an infinite source of energy, albeit at a limited rate, using these devices. The same developments also brought about interstellar travel, powered by deeper knowledge about the very fabric of space-time itself, and the ability to tear precise 'holes' in this fabric, colloquially known as warping. The operation of these QFGs was so complex that no single human understood their operation entirely. In the recent years since the discovery of Xenon Earth and unique ability to enhance supercomputing, the task of operating and maintaining them was therefore left almost entirely to various artificial intelligence constructs.</p> <p>She stifled a yawn and glanced at her wristwatch. It had been hours since the last landing party had reported back their last readings of the atmosphere.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Averages are useful but can be misleading when regimes switch (see above chart).</li> <li>Once you have chosen a measure of volatility, stop distance can then be back-tested and optimised. For example does 2x ATR work best or 5x ATR for a given style and time horizon?\u00a0</li> <li>Discretionary traders may still eye-ball the ATR or standard deviation to get a feeling for how it has changed over time and what \u2018normal\u2019 feels like for a chosen study period - daily, weekly, monthly etc. For example, below shows the daily move in EURUSD was around 60 pips before spiking to 140 pips in March.

You know what the purpose of this select committee is. We are exploring the risks, the ways in which deliberate online falsehoods are spread, and we are primarily restricting ourselves to deliberate online falsehoods. We call them DOFs, and what we should do about the situation. So I think it's useful to be clear about the approach we are going to take in these discussions. We see you, the entire panel, as people who enable communications and technology enables communications. It has brought immense benefits. It has revolutionized societies. It has given more freedom to people. And at the same time, there are some issues, and we see you as partners in trying to deal with those issues. So I'll start with Facebook. Mr. Milner, Mr. Tan, thank you for being here. You have shared our concerns and commitments to achieve these goals. So if I could invite you to look at your written representation of the 2nd of March. I think you say that quite clearly, what you see your obligations as, and a commitment which you share with us. You say so. And at page 2, you say that it's a shared responsibility and you take it seriously. I think that's not controversial. I would like to start by discussing with Facebook some elements of your philosophy generally. And I think what I say would apply to the others as well. And if you disagree at any point, please feel free to jump in and give us your views. I think as a major Internet company, Mr. Milner and Mr. Tan, Facebook has provided a platform for at least a couple of billion people more. And it has made its commitment to transparency. So if I can invite you to look at some documents, they will be shown on the screen. Your commitment to the Facebook community, 30th of November, 2011. You have said, I think there's something wrong with this site. Let me in the interest of time read it out to you . Facebook has always been committed to being transparent about the information you have stored with us. And we have led Internet in building tools to give people the ability to see and control what they share. But we can also always do better. I'm committed to making Facebook the leader in transparency and control around privacy. Then May 11, 2012, Facebook News, title Enhancing Transparency in Our Data Use Policy. When we launched our redesigned data use policy last year, our goal was to create a more transparent guide to how we use data when people use Facebook . And third, Facebook News, in December 18, last year, 2017, we believe that sharing information about IP reports we receive from rights holders is an important step towards being more open and clear about how we protect the people and businesses that use our service. Publishing this report reinforces our important commitment to transparency as we build community and bring the world closer together. And May 15 of last year, an article in Marketing Week, it refers to statements made by Ms. Mendelsohn. Ms. Mendelsohn used her speech to claim that being open is one of Facebook's five core pillars and that it's striving to be the most open and transparent company about our own metrics. We take this commitment to being open and transparent very seriously. We are committed to providing the tools and partnerships to make that possible for all advertisers. Openness is not something we switch on in good times and off in the bad. If anything, it is even more important to have it when things are perhaps not going so well. That sets out your position and some of your core principles, correct? Correct. Thank you. And you are now before this parliamentary select committee representing the people of this country and this is a serious discussion. And would you agree to make progress, we need to be full, frank and honest. Yes. Thank you. Now, Mr. Milner, I think you have gone to several parliaments around the world to give evidence, among them the UK parliament as well as the Israeli Nessit.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: This may be number four, I think.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Thank you. My country's. Can I refer to a statement that was issued on the 16th of March? You probably have spent some time looking at this . It is just a few days ago. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Cogan lied to us and violated our platform policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook login to SCOL Cambridge Analyt ica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe, and approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. Now, there is an article in the Guardian, which I 'm sure you're aware of, but we will flash it anyway, 18th of March, which makes a claim that between June and August of 2014, more than 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested by Cambridge Analytica. And your CEO, I think last night, this morning Singapore time, said about 300,000 people, the app was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as their friends' data. And given the way our platform worked at this time meant that Cogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends' data. I think all of this is factual. You've got to say yes so that we are transparent.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Yes, that's correct.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Thank you. Now, Facebook knew about this breach in 2015, that at least 270,000 users and tens of millions of their friends, their data had been given to Cambridge Analytica without permission in clear violation of the rules. Correct?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: In clear violation of our terms, yes.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Now, I would like to understand how this breach occurred. Dr. Cogan had developed an app. Facebook users downloaded the app. Their data and data relating to their friends were then accessible to Dr. Cogan. So far we are within Facebook's policies and rules, correct?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: At the time, yes.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And at the time you work on the basis that the Facebook users who downloaded the app agreed to harvesting of their information by Dr. Cogan at that time.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I wouldn't necessarily \u2013 the word harvesting did not appear in our terms nor did it appear in the terms that the people would see as they agreed to access that app and make use of its features.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: What term would you use?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I would have to come back to you on exactly that term, but the word harvest is a colloquialism that's been used in some of the reporting on it. Not to suggest that this is not problematic, but that's not a term that was used in the</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: report. Well, would you describe that their data was accessible to and used by Dr. Cogan?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Yes, we've been clear about that. But just to be clear, this isn't all data that had been shared by their friends. It's certain features of their data that was</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: added. Mr. Milner, we can spend a lot of time discussing small details. I think you understand the essence of the point.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I do understand the essence.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Thank you. Dr. Cogan then passed that information to Cambridge Analytica.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Yes, and it's in doing that that he very clearly breached our terms and that's why we acted as we did.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Can I now refer you to some answers you gave to the British Parliament in their select committee? This was on the 8th of February to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee. Can we look at question 447? Mr. Matheson asked you, \"Well, let's see how we get on with the questions and if you are able to answer them, have you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?\" And the answer was no. We then go on to question 448. But they do hold a large chunk of Facebook's user data, don't they? No, they may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves but it's not data that we have provided. And question 473. The chair says, \"We have a session later on with some of the news media organizations so I'm sure we'll be able to ask them about that too. I just have a couple of clarification questions I want to ask before we finish. Going back to the discussion on Facebook developers, Mr. Milner, you said it was not true that developers had Facebook user data but they had data about people on Facebook. I just wondered what the difference was between these two things. I suppose I was initially assuming that Mr. Math eson was saying, \"Have you provided data? Has Facebook provided data to Cambridge Analytica or some other outside entity?\" We do not provide your data to anyone without your permission but the developer, the system that Ms. Bickert was talking about does allow people to decide. I'm prepared to let them have some of my Facebook data in order to get a service from them. Mr. Milner, would you agree that you are being very careful and economical with the truth in giving these answers?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: No, I would not. Can I explain why? Sure. On the basis of what I understood to be true at the time, I believe my answers were entirely accurate in that we have never provided data to Cambridge Analytica. We understood at the time that came because of the undertakings that Cambridge Analytica had given to us, including sworn legal affidavits , that they had no Facebook data. Indeed, subsequent to this, and you may want to refer to this, their CEO appeared before exactly that same committee and said they did not have Facebook data.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I have referred to that. At least I have looked at it. Let's explore that a little bit, Mr. Milner. Cambridge Analytica obtained the Facebook user data. It was a large chunk, as we now know. And I'll remind you on question 458 again. Can we have that? The question was a large chunk was with them. And in question 473, you draw a distinction between what Facebook provides and what the app developers obtain themselves, focused on Cambridge Analytica. Now that's why I said you were being very careful and economical with the truth. You were trying to answer a very precise question while you knew the facts you knew were that a large amount of data had been accessed in breach of your rules. You knew that at that time. Whether they still had it or not is irrelevant for the time being.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Actually, I think it was highly relevant to the question that was being asked by Mr. Matheson. Can I finish my question? Of course, I apologize.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Yes. First point is, on the 8th of February, when you gave evidence to the select committee, you knew that a large amount of data had been accessed by Cambridge Analytica in breach of your rules and policies. The question was, did you give any information to Cambridge Analytica? Can I suggest to you, in the context of being full, frank, and honest, which you said you had to be with us, and I'm sure you offer the same courtesy to the UK Parliament, one would have then said, \"We did not give it.\" But you know what? In breach of our policies, a large amount of data had in fact been accessed by Cambridge Analytica. Can I suggest to you that would have been a full, frank, and honest answer?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I agree with you that with hindsight, I could have explained more, but just to be clear, I did answer accurately. Let me just stop you there. Could I finish my answer in the same way I asked you to?</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Let me ask you another question, and then you can carry on. So with hindsight, you agree with me. What has changed between then and now that you feel that this is the answer that should have been given to the British Parliament on the</p> <p>Mr. Milner: 8th of February? I'm merely explaining that I feel it's unfortunate that yourself and members of that committee feel that I was in any way economical. I felt that at the time I was giving truthful answers to questions, which actually was a minor part of a broader hearing in which we covered lots of other issues. And therefore, of course now with hindsight, especially given recent events, I wish I had said more. But at the time, and especially given the evidence we then heard from Mr. Nix at that same committee within a couple of weeks, it felt like actually things were wrapped up. Just really only the events of the last few days and the things that have come to light in terms of these investigations, which are still allegations to be investigated now by the information commissioner in the UK, then I wish perhaps I'd said more. But what I said was what I knew to be true at the time. And that's exactly what I'm also going to share with this committee today.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Mr. Milner, let's just be quite direct here. There was no excuse for not giving this information on the 8th of February.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I'm not trying to make excuses. And if you feel that I am, I...</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: No, I'm asking for your comment. I'm suggesting to you that there was no excuse for not telling the whole truth and being full, frank and honest on the 8th of February.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Often in committees rather like this one, people want short answers rather than long ones. I gave a truthful answer to the committee. All my answers were true, as were those of Ms. B ickett, based on what we knew then. And I'm here today and happy to answer your questions about what we know now and also what we don't know yet. And that's hence the investigation. You just didn't answer my question. I feel I have answered your question.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Well, let me put it to you again. There is no excuse for you not to have been full, frank and honest on the 8th of February with the UK Parliament.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I was frank and honest with that committee. I could have provided a fuller answer, but I do think it's unfair to suggest that there was no excuse. There were good reasons based on the range of issues being discussed in that committee as to why we didn't go into more detail at the</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: time. Let me understand. The reason why you were not full and gave \u2013 the reason why you did not give a complete answer was because this was a minor part of the entire discussion?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: No, it's because the committee were particularly interested in whether Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data now and whether it was relevant during the 2016 presidential election in the US. Based on what I understood to be true, which is that Cambridge Analytica had no Facebook data and because we had a sworn affidavit to that effect from them, I didn't feel it was necessary to go into that level of detail. But everything I said to the committee was true based on what I understood to be the time and it may still be true.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Mr. Milner, we can have very long answers. I'm prepared to let you answer as long as you like, but there is little purpose in repeating the same thing over and over again about what you knew. We all know what you knew. I had a very specific question. One of your reasons for not being full and frank with this UK Select Committee, which you gave to us, is that this was a minor part of the hearing which covered a lot of other issues, correct?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I think I said it was one of many issues.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Let me quote you your exact words. This was a minor part of a broader hearing in which we covered lots of other issues.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Okay. I stand by what I said.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Do you stand by that answer? I stand by what I said. So the breach and loss of 50 million or breach of your regulations leading to unlawful access of data relating to 50 million users, in your view, is a minor issue?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: No. The committee hearing was all about fake news like this one. There were lots of other questions. Let me ask you a further question. Only one committee member asked me about this and there were as many, more members than there are here, asked me questions about a range of other issues. I suggest if one committee member asked questions about something, it's reasonable to suggest that was a minor part of a much broader hearing.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I come back to my question. I'm quite happy, Mr. Milner, to ask you the question as many times as you wish. In your view, was this question not answered fully because it was a minor part of the entire proceedings?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: No, I think as I've explained, but I do feel I'm repeating myself. Because you're not answering the question. I wish, of course, I'd explained more, Ben. And now that committee has asked for Facebook to come and make further representations.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: We are now exploring the reasons. Would you like to amend your answer that it was a minor part and that's really not a good reason for not having been full and frank with the committee?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I'm happy to explain. This was one of many questions that I was asked about the issue of fake news and what Facebook was doing about it. As with, and often committees are looking for short answers so they can ask questions of other witnesses as well. And do I wish I'd given a fuller answer?</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Right. Now, would you agree that every question asked by the members requires full and proper answers?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I'd be interested in your own definition of what full means. Right. Especially when you want to try to get through lots of issues.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Let's take this for example. The members of the select committee were interested more than one because they came back to this question a number of times as to whether any data had been given by you, whether there has been any breach of privacy, and whether in some way data had been accessed. Facebook users' data had been accessed.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Actually, I don't recall there being any questions about there being a breach of privacy.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Well, they didn't specifically use the word privacy. You obviously know the notes very well and so do I. But that was an issue they were dealing with, even though they didn't say privacy, amongst other issues. So questions were related to Cambridge Analytica, whether they had accessed information, and there were concerns. A full answer in my view, and I think you've accepted it, you know, answer to the questions would have been we did not give the information to Cambridge Analytica. But a developer whose app 270,000 people downloaded allowed him to access data for 50 million users, and that did end up with Cambridge Analyt ica. And you know what, we took steps to ask them to confirm that they no longer have that data. That would have been a full, frank and honest answer.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I respect your view on that, and as I think I've been clear about with hindsight, I could have said more. But the answers I gave were true based on what I</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: knew to be true at the time. Based on what you needed to be true? No, what I knew to be true at the time.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Not what I needed to be true, what I knew to be true.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: What you knew to be true. Correct. Your answers are not very consistent. If necessary, we'll come back to that in a minute .</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I believe they are, but I'm happy to come back to it if you wish.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: You're obviously aware of Mr. Zuckerberg's comments last night on his Facebook. Let's look at them. He says, \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't, then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago.\" And then again later on, \"There was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it.\" And I'm sure you're aware of what Ms. Sandberg has said. If I can show that to you. Again last night. Sharing Mark's post addressing the Cambridge Analytica news, as he said, \"We know that this was a major violation of people's trust, and I deeply regret that we didn't do enough to deal with it. We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't, then we don't deserve to serve you.\" And the last paragraph there, \"You deserve to have your information protected.\" Sorry, can you go back to Ms. Sandberg's? And we'll keep working to make sure you feel safe on Facebook. Your trust is at the core of our service. We know that and we'll work to earn it. So there is an acceptance that this was a major breach of trust by Facebook. Yes. And the user's trust is at the core of Facebook's services. Yes?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Yes, that's right.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And users deserve to have their information protected. Yes? And when that trust is breached, the company should be transparent?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: That's what we said, and indeed we've committed that we will communicate with all the people who are affected by this.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And it should be open?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: By open, what do you mean? In terms of we will -- because we shouldn't share with other people. It would be the people that have been directly impacted. We will let them know.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: It should be open with them? Yes. And it should be open with the public that a</p> <p>Mr. Milner: breach has occurred? That a breach of trust has occurred?</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Yes. And not play verbal games? Sorry? Not play verbal games?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I'm not sure I follow you. I'm sure you do. I'm not sure I do. Can you explain further?</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: This is going to be interesting. There is -- when one says full, frank and honest and transparent and a duty to be open and a duty to tell the users, then you do that and you don't try and fob off those responsibilities</p> <p>Mr. Milner: . I strongly suggest that what our CEO has said today and the quotes as well that you've got there from our COO, Sharma Sandberg, in no way do they suggest -- I'm not suggesting them.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I haven't suggested them. I hadn't finished. So I wasn't suggesting anything about Mr. Zucker berg or Ms. Sandberg.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: So are you suggesting that I am somehow fobbing</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: off? Well, I'm asking you a general question that --</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Please ask a hard question.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Well, yes. There will be hard questions. I start with a general question. Having established that there needs to be trust, that there needs to be openness, that there needs to be transparency, would you agree that when one comes across an instance where there's been a breach, one accepts it openly and not try and avoid it by using language which sort of hides what happened? Would you accept that?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: When our terms have been breached, we owe it to people to let them know if they're affected by it.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Correct. Thank you. Let's look at question 474 again to the U.K. Parliament. Now, given what I've just taken you through about being open and frank and honest, what do you think the answer to that question should be if you're asked the question today?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Question 474. Yes. Can we just read it out? Shall I read it or would you like to? You can read it out. So I just want to be clear what you mean, what you meant, because it was not clear at the time. A Facebook developer then has gathered data about Facebook users because they have interacted with the tools that they have created on the platform. If that Facebook user then decides to leave Facebook, does the developer keep the data that they have gathered? My colleague Monica Bickert, who is our VP for product policies globally, said, no, that is in our policies. They actually have to delete the data once that person is no longer using the service. I would also note that you do not have to leave Facebook to make that decision. If you have interacted with an app on Facebook and you decide I don't want to do that anymore, you can go to your settings on Facebook and turn that off and reject that. Then they have to delete your data. Now, that's, yes, in terms of your original question, yes, that's accurate.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: In the context of what we know now and you knew then, where Dr. Cogan had accessed the information and passed it on to Cambridge Analyt ica, would you answer the question in the same way? Or would you point out that actually a major breach had occurred and there is at least one instance that you know where information was passed on to a third party?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Well, in terms of the question, if Facebook user then decides to leave Facebook, does the developer keep the data that they have gathered? Yes, I think the answer should remain exactly the same. I'm not sure why, because this wasn't specifically about Alexander Cogan or Cambridge Analytica.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: You would not think there is a duty to point out that in fact a major breach had occurred and information had passed on.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Not in respect of that question, because that question is about our broad policies and their application for users.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Would you agree in respect of the other questions ? You should have given this answer?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I think I've already answered that a number of</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: times. Up to yesterday, there was no admission that there was such a major breach, correct?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: We have not said. We said there's a major breach of trust.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: There was no admission of major breach of trust.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Actually I would have to go back to Mr. Gruel's post on Friday to see whether or not he used those words. I'm afraid I don't have his newsroom post in front of me to know whether he used those</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: words. Exactly. Up to Friday or up to yesterday.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: That was on Friday. I'm happy to check that out and come back to you unless you have it on your screen.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I do, but let's take it as Friday. Prior to Friday, there has been no admission of any major breach, no public admission,</p> <p>Mr. Milner: correct? Of a breach of trust.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Yes. Thank you. I know you want to be very careful for legal considerations. I do, because I know what you're driving towards. Yes. You don't need to anticipate. Why don't we get there more quickly? We will get to the questions that I want to ask. I'm sorry.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: That was disrespectful. I apologize.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Now, you are aware of the letter from Mr. Collins</p> <p>Mr. Milner: . To Mark Zuckerberg. Yes.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Yes, I am. Committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent. Your officials' answers have consistently underst ated this risk and have been misleading to the committee. Do you accept that?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Well, evidently, based on what I've already said, I don't. But I do understand why Mr. Collins is frustrated and why he's asked us to appear again, and we will do so.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Evidently, based on what you've said, that your answers could have been more full, I think Mr. Collins has a right, objectively, to feel that way. Would you agree?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Look, he's his own person. I know Mr. Collins very well. But I don't suggest that he's a...</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Mr. Milner, Mr. Milner, please. Could I just... I have a question. You've made a very clear allegation I'd like to respond to. Can I ask this? My questions are designed for a yes or no answer. So give a yes or no, and then you can carry on with your explanations. Let me repeat my question. Go back. Given... I read out to you what Mr. Collins' letter says, and I say, given what we have... My apologies. Given what we have said about your answers being more full, I think Mr. Collins has, objectively, a right to feel that he has been mis led. Let me put it that way. Do you agree or disagree?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: No, I never misled him.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I didn't say that. I didn't ask that question. I think you're smart enough to know what I'm asking.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I do, but I don't think I can put myself in the shoes of Mr. Collins in the way you suggest.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: No, I'm talking about objective perception.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I think you're as good a judge of that as I am. I'm not going to... Well... I do not think I can give you a yes or no answer to that question. That's what Mr. Collins...</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Let's try again. Let's try again. I think you're smart enough to know that it is capable of a yes or no answer. Let me explain why. We have your admission that your answers could have been more full. There is no two ways about it. That's clear. You could have been more full. Mr. Collins has taken the view that you have been misleading to the committee. Just based on that, my suggestion to you is, objectively, anyone looking at those two answers, your statement that you could have been more full in the context of his questions, I say it's reasonable. I'm not saying you take that view. It's reasonable for someone to come to a conclusion that you have misled the committee. It's a reasonable possibility. Different people may take different views, but it is a reasonable view. Would you agree?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I agree that different people can take different</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: views. And it is a reasonable view.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I agree that different people can take different views.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I've asked you another question.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: A reasonable person can take that view. A reasonable person could take that view. Thank you.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Mr. Collins again on the 18th of March. Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. Facebook knew about this and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it and deliberately avoided answering straight questions from the committee about it. It is not acceptable that Facebook have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that FB's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed. Just focusing on the first part of what I read out, Facebook knew about this and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it and deliberately avoided answering straight questions from the committee about it. Again, I'm not saying that this is your view, but a reasonable person looking at what has happened could take that view.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: With the information we have now, yes, but not at</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: the time. What is the additional information you have now?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: We've had some pretty major media stories which suggested that contrary to the undertakings we were given, individuals and companies including Cambridge Analytica retained Facebook data that they told us, legally verified that they had deleted. That was new information which did not come to light, was certainly not available to me or anyone else on February 8th, only came to light because of the media reports over the weekend.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Why is that material to the answer?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Because Mr Collins has suggested that I knowingly</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: lied. He certainly suggests that, but I'm trying to explore your reasons for disagreeing with</p> <p>Mr. Milner: him. Can you see the wording again that he used? Because I think you're suggesting that those words essentially said that somebody knowingly lied or something to that effect. I don't want to misquote him, so I'd like to see the wording again.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: We can see that. Facebook knew about this and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it and deliberately avoided answering straight.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: The word deliberately misled, I think on the basis of, somebody might conclude that on the basis of what we know now, but not at the time because we did not know about these stories and these allegations.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Let's just focus on Facebook knew about this and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it and deliberately avoided answering straight questions. Let's look at what you knew at that time. You knew that there had been a major breach of</p> <p>Mr. Milner: your policies. Of trust and our policies. Yes, a breach of our policies.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Breach of your policies. You knew that there has been a major breach of trust on your part, right?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Well, we understood that the breach of our policies had been contained. We have said now that actually we should have taken the step of notifying users and that was a mistake that we made.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Right. So you knew on the 8th of February that there was a major breach of trust on your part?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: We knew there'd been a breach of our policies. We did not know that contrary to those undertak ings that they still, apparently it is alleged, we still don't know for certain that they have</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: been targeted. Mr. Milner, you are very, very keen to answer questions which I don't ask. You seem to not be very keen to answering the questions that I do ask. The question I asked was not whether you knew that or you believed that they had been deleted. The question that I asked is you knew on the 8th of February that there had been a major breach of trust on your part. Do you agree?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: We knew there'd been a breach of our policies and that we should have done better by our</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: users. No, I am asking a very specific question. You knew that there'd been a major breach of trust on your part towards the Facebook users.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I can understand why you'd like a simple yes/no answer. I do think it is more nuanced than you're</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: suggesting. Well, look, why...</p> <p>Mr. Milner: But this does not mean that we think that, you know, looking back on it, as I've been very clear, I should have provided a fuller answer to the committee and made them more aware of what we understood to be true. And I've recognised that and I recognise that this is my first opportunity publicly to say it and I appreciate your questions have enabled me to do that. Thank you. But I was not deliberately misleading the committee. I was not trying to be acute with my answers. I genuinely thought I was being helpful in the context of what that committee was looking into at the time, which was about did Cambridge Analytica have Facebook data now? And my genuine understanding at the time, as was for our company as a whole, was that they did not.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: You probably know this better than I do, but I don't think the UK Parliament asked you a question as to whether Cambridge Analytica had the data with them. But let's not get into that. We're getting into the weeds. Just based on your last answer, I think you'll be prepared, therefore, to agree to the question I first asked you some minutes ago, that Mr Collins was entitled and a reasonable person is entitled to take the view that Facebook knew about the breach of its policies and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica in the breach of those policies and deliberately avoided answering straight questions from the committee about it. No. He's not entitled to take that view.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Well, sorry, because it was such a long question, I rather lost the beginning. I agree that he is entitled to take that view. Thank you. And he clearly has done so.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Now, let's now go to the second part of your long answer which you gave just now. Leaving aside Mr Collins, between what you knew on the 8th of February and what you know now, on the 8th of February, you knew that there had been a major breach of your policies,</p> <p>Mr. Milner: yes? We did know there had been a breach of our policies, yes.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: You wouldn't characterise it as major?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I mean, it's not a phrase that we've used, but I 'm happy for us to use it in this context, given what has transpired since then and what we are now doing as a company.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: What has transpired since then is irrelevant to whether it was major or minor. 50 million Facebook accounts, data, you would, anyone would call it major?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Well, yes. However, isn't it also worth pointing out that we were told at the time by Cambridge Analytica we've never used this data and we've</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: deleted it? We will come to that. We will come to that. There is a certain logical flow to my questions, I hope, and it will be good if we can keep to that and have the questions I ask answered. So let's recap again. On the 8th of February, you knew that there had been a major breach of your policies. You also knew that there was a breach of trust by you towards your users. Would you accept that? Yes. Thank you. Now, the only thing that has changed between the 8th of February and today is that there have been some additional reports that Cambridge Analytica actually continued to have this data, correct?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: And made extensive use of it.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Right. You don't believe that the first two data points I referred to are enough for you to have been upfront and say, yes, put your hands up and say, sorry, there's been a major breach. Cambridge Analytica accessed our data. We were in \u2013 there's a major breach of trust between us and our Facebook users. You don't think that was enough for you to say that?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I think I've been clear that I wish, with hindsight, I'd given a fuller answer. But just to be clear, that hearing like this was about fake news. It was not about data privacy. There was no mention of Alexander Kogan. Imagine how long my answer would have had to have been to lay out all that into what was a very simple question, which is, have you given your data to Cambridge Analytica? Do Cambridge Analytica have Facebook data? So in answer to those two relatively short, simple questions, I gave short, simple answers. As I've made very clear, in an inquiry which was very broad, and this was only one member asking questions about this, and frankly it was \u2013 it felt like a tangent compared to the rest of the discussion. If you look at the rest of the proceedings, this was a tangent away from the main purpose of the hearing. As I've \u2013 I think I've been very clear that, with hindsight, would I have preferred to have given longer answers to those questions?</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Yes. Mr Milner, you can take it. You obviously realize I've read the transcripts in some detail. Now, I don't want to extend these proceedings, but you know, really, to sit there and give answers like that was a small part of the discussion, somehow suggesting therefore you didn't have the need to be full and frank, or it excuses your answers, doesn't really wash.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I don't think I am making excuses. I'm explaining.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Well, those explanations don't hold any water. Can we move on? I'm sorry you feel like that. Yes, I do feel like that.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I'm really sorry you feel like that, because I genuinely am trying to \u2013 as per the affirmation I've made, I'm giving you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and the answers I'm providing to you.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Let's move on to another point. The Facebook did not inform any of the 270,000 users or their friends that the information had been illegitimately accessed, correct?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Well, the 270 \u2013 no, you're correct. Thank you.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: The first time Facebook announced this was last week, more than two years after it found out about the breach, correct? Yes. Your CEO says in a CNN interview, \"I regret we didn't do it at the time. I think we got that wrong.\" You accept that?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Yes, and I've said that already.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And all of this conduct goes against the profess ed commitments of Facebook \u2013 I read those out just now \u2013 of being transparent about the information users have stored with Facebook, Facebook being the leader in transparency and control around privacy, being more open and clear about how we protect people and businesses we serve, and to be the most open and transparent company and how user data is protected. Your conduct is contrary to all of these principles, correct, in this instance?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: In this instance, yes.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Yes. You did not tell the public. You did not tell the UK Parliamentary Committee. You did not even tell the users whose data had been shared. Quite unacceptable?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I think our CEO's words make it very clear this was a mistake, we got it wrong. But it doesn't mean that the rest of those commitments are... Would you accept that it's quite unacceptable? We've said that. We got it wrong. We should have told people.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: These professed commitments seen against your conduct, are they true statements of intention or are they pure verbiage?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: They're absolutely a true statement, not just of intention but of our actions. I can provide plenty of information to this committee to demonstrate that.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: The best example illustration of statements of intention is actual conduct. So why did you not tell the users whose data was subject of this serious breach?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I wasn't involved in that decision and I'm afraid I can't...</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Well, you've come here to give evidence. I'm asking you, you're representing Facebook. Do you have an answer?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I'm happy to see if we can provide that information to you but I don't want... Given I wasn't involved in that decision, I think you'd understand why I don't want to speculate about it.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Well, then I'll have to ask you as a reasonable man with some knowledge of Facebook's operations that there must have been a good reason why there was no public announcement and that users were not informed.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I really would like to be helpful but I don't want to speculate because I was not involved in that decision. I think it would be wrong for me to speculate.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Right. I'm asking you as a reasonable person, does it look odd to you that users were not contacted and the public were not informed?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: It definitely looks like a decision that we made the wrong call. We should have let people know and our CEO has owned that decision and said we got that</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: wrong. You would accept that you both have a moral as well as a legal obligation to inform the</p> <p>Mr. Milner: users? We wouldn't be admitting that we've breached people's trust if that were not the case. Thank you. A moral obligation to do it, you're absolutely correct. As I understand it, there was not a legal obligation to do it but that's by the by.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I know that you say that you don't want to speculate but if you informed the public when you first found out, 2015, or if you told 270,000 users or 50 million whose data had been abused, that would be a huge matter in public, wouldn't it? As it now is.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: You may well be right.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And perhaps that was a reason why it wasn't made</p> <p>Mr. Milner: public. I think I've been really clear on this. I don't want to speculate about something, a decision I was not involved in and I'm happy to investigate that and come back to the committee on it.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: How this happened, what Mr. Cogan did, could have been done by anyone else, any of the other app developers, correct?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: That's why we've committed to investigating and auditing all apps that were operating in that way at the time.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: You see, Mr. Mulla, my questions are designed for a yes or no answer and I'm quite happy for you to explain. Yes.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Thank you. And that's why we are investigating all apps that were operational at the time.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Could Facebook have seen that Dr. Cogan was pulling huge amounts of user data off the network?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I'm sorry, I don't quite understand what you mean . In terms of, were we aware of this app and its size? Is that what you mean? Yes, I mean, our systems would have known that that was happening. Of course, what we didn't know is what Mr. Cogan was doing thereafter.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I mean, I say I know, I don't. But I assume that you knew that he was accessing</p> <p>Mr. Milner: all of this data. Did we have knowledge? Yes.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Thank you. Did you check and verify that his purposes were legitimate in accessing such a huge amount of data?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I think we've been clear on this in our public statements, which is he signed up to our terms. He agreed to our terms and under those terms he said he was conducting academic research and that information was available and known to us and was within, was acceptable within</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: our terms. So the answer to my question is you didn't check. You accepted what he said.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: As we do, we were accepting on trust many other developers as well at the time who were, and the purposes of which they were. As indeed all app platforms, including operated by others on this panel, did at the time and</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: many still do. Let's look at another aspect of this, how Facebook reacted when it learned of the breach. 16th of March 2018, your statement says, \"We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.\" That's what you say your commitment is. Let's look at what you did. You removed Dr. Kogan's app, right?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Yes.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: You asked Dr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to confirm that all information has been deleted? Yes. And you found out, according to you, last week, two years later, that contrary to the certifications you were given, not all the data was deleted.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: That's not quite accurate. We didn't find that out. We now have an allegation and because of that allegation we want to investigate.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: So you first heard of this allegation last week? Correct. And so you're aggressively moving to determine the accuracy of these claims? Yes. Now, why wasn't this verified two years ago when the certifications were first given?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Well, again, that's something that, of course, with hindsight, we wish we'd done that. And that's one of the lessons for us as to in terms of why we are now going to audit all other apps and not just take their \u2013 what's the word I'm looking for? The affirmation, perhaps for want of a better word, that they have deleted data or have not passed it on. We're now going to audit them.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Mr. Milner, you're dealing with someone who had acted in very serious breach of your rules, Dr. Kogan, according to you, right? Yes. And you are completely happy to take his words on trust after that and his certifications without taking any steps to verify yourself?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Well, I think, again, I think Mr. Groves \u2013</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: No, my questions are capable of being answered directly and then you can explain.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Would you mind repeating the question?</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: You are dealing with a person, Dr. Kogan, who had already committed a huge breach of your rules. He had accessed a huge amount of data. This was, as you yourself recognized, a serious breach of your trust with your users.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: And of our terms.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And of your terms. And you were quite happy to just accept a certification from Dr. Kogan that he is now telling the truth and he has deleted everything?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: That was the action we took at the time.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I understand. Do you think it looks odd that you did not take further steps to verify?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: With hindsight, yes.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: How has time improved your perception of this</p> <p>Mr. Milner: matter? Because if, if, if \u2013 we don't know them to be certain \u2013 if Mr. Wiley's allegations prove to be correct, then we have been duped and this has had consequences for potentially millions of our users and that's a really terrible place for our company to be.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I understand. But again, I think you are smart enough to know the question I really asked. Forget about Mr. Wiley and forget about all the additional data points you now have. Go back to two years ago. You have a person who had breached your rules. You have a major breach in your hands. By him and by you, breach of trust to your users. You have all of this. And you are happy to receive a certification from this gentleman and say that, oh, that makes it all right and we trust him. Does that look odd to you?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Actually, I would suggest that you're a lawyer. I would suggest that the kind of verification that we received from him was significantly above and beyond just taking him on trust.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: That wasn't the question that I asked. The question I asked is, you are quite happy. Does it look odd to you to just accept a certification from him?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I don't say we were quite happy. That's not the phrase I would use. And it's very clear now that with hindsight we may have been \u2013 it may have been a very bad mistake on our part to have taken that legal \u2013 not just his word, but a legal verification that the data had been deleted by him, by Cambridge Analytica, by Mr. Wiley's firm, that it may prove to be that that was a big mistake and we should not have done that.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Mr. Muller, let's leave out the additional information you have received. Let's stick to what you knew prior to these latest allegations. Let's stick to that. I think you understand my question. Just based on the fact that Dr. Kogan accessed this information and used it contrary to your rules, and we accept it's a major breach, and which also puts you in a major breach of trust situation with your users, those are the facts. Forget about all the subsequent events. On those facts, your view \u2013 can I suggest to you that it looks odd that you did not do anything beyond accepting this certification? Yes or no?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I don't think that question is answerable as a straight yes or no. There is always context. And with hindsight, obviously yes.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Hindsight \u2013 and it doesn't have to really involve these additional allegations. Even without these additional allegations, can I suggest to you that one would have expected a half-competent firm with legal advice to say we now need to go in there and check whether there is data continuing to remain because this person has already acted in gross breach and we ought to now make sure that our user's data is properly protected and therefore deleted? Wouldn't you consider that to be a reasonable course of action?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: We clearly should have acted differently at the</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: time. And you are not a half-competent firm. You are one of the world's most competent firms.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Thank you very much. At the moment, it doesn't feel quite like that.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And therefore, the point is this cannot be an oversight.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Look, we'd be really clear. I've been at Facebook for six years. This is one of the worst weeks in my time there. I hope I'm not contributing to it. I appreciate the effort you've clearly put into really understanding the issues and to quizzing me hard about this. And I expected it. We are having to make amends for significant mistakes that were made in the company. And I hope you see from the statement from our CEO overnight and his interview on CNN, there is determination from the very top to figure out what went wrong, to correct it, to learn from it, and to make sure it does not happen again.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: So let's then have some clear answers. A reasonable company, when it first came to know about this breach by Dr. Kogan and the fact that information has gotten on to Cambridge Analytica, should have done a few things. It should have notified the users. It should have gone public with what had happened . And it should have taken further steps to ensure that the data had been deleted. Agree?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Agree. We said all that.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And can you give us a credible, understandable reason why -- and what I'm saying is not rocket science. It's fairly basic. I was in practice for over 20 years. It's the first thing lawyers would tell you to do . So can you give us a credible, reasonable, understandable explanation as to why that did not happen? And if you cannot, please say you cannot.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I don't want to speculate. Thank you.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: But it seems obvious that if you had done that in 2014 or 2015, the way in which the app developers could access users' data, the fact that there has been such a major breach of privacy, the fact that information has been abused, all of this would have broken out all over Facebook. And Facebook would have had to deal with these public issues. That would have been a natural consequence of any announcement then. Agree? I'm not suggesting that you didn't announce because of that. But I'm just asking you to agree that what is happening now would have happened in 2015.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Actually, I disagree in that the allegations that have come to light in recent days I would suggest could be even more serious than the issues of what we did in 2014, 2015 in not notifying people then and not verifying that the data had indeed been deleted. So I'm not sure if that --</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: I'm afraid you're not answering the question. I think we are again talking past each other. The simple point is this. In 2015, if you had made an announcement that there has been a breach, major breach, 300,000 users' data has been abused, 50 million users' data has been abused, it's been passed on, there would have been a number of questions that Facebook would have had to answer in public at that point in time.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Agree? Yes, and we would have said at the time we've had verification from these companies and individuals that they've deleted the data.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Right. And you probably would then have had to say that that's not good enough and we should do more.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I expect, given the way the information commissioner in the UK has reacted to recent events and the fact that she has sought a warrant from a court to go in and inspect Cambridge Analytica's data, we may well have been in the same position. It was a different information commissioner at the time, but I expect he, Christopher Graham, probably would have taken the same action . So we may have ended up with the same -- it may not have been us doing it, it might have been the information commissioner, as is what is happening right now.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Well, we leave out the UK information commissioner, we leave out the UK parliament. I'm focusing on Facebook and what you would have had to do. And I think given your earlier admissions that your actions were not adequate, the only difference is that we now know in 2018, March, that your actions were not adequate. If you had admitted to all of this in 2015, then we would all know that your actions were not adequate at that point in time and you would have had to take more actions.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Actually, I'm not sure I agree with you in the sense of if we'd, in 2015, said, \"Hey, this has happened, this is what we've done about it,\" I think people may have said, \"Well, that's really bad that that happened,\" but it's good that you are notifying people and it's good that you're taking action against these companies and exposing them. So I'm not sure I agree that people would then have concluded that our actions were inadequate.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Mr. Milner, you strike me, and I mean this genuinely, as a very smart man. Let me say this to you. In 2015, if you had gone out there and said, \"Dr. Kogan had accessed 270,000 accounts and another 50 million accounts from there, and a huge amount of data has been abused, and not just by him, but he's passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, and Cambridge Analytica does all these things. And we are now satisfied that neither of them have any information because there is a certification from those two entities. Do you think it's reasonable to think that both the public and the authorities would have asked you, \"Shouldn't you be doing more?\"</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I expect what would have happened then is that people would also...</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: No, please answer the question.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Can I just... I don't think it's a yes/no answer, Mr. Jambugan. I do think it has to... There is nuance in this answer. And as yours is a long question, it's quite hard to answer a long question with a straight yes or no.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: It is quite easy that the public and the agencies ...</p> <p>Mr. Milner: It may be easy, but it may give the wrong impression that this is all very straightforward.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: It may give an impression that you would rather avoid giving.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: No, I want to be really full and frank with this committee, just as you've asked me to be. Yes. If you look at what happened when I gave a yes/no answer to the UK committee, you have suggested that I wasn't full and frank. I didn't think I saw a yes and no answer.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And now you're trying to give very short answers. Mr. Milner, I will stand corrected, but I've seen your answers to the UK committee. They were very long. Not all of them, clearly.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Some of them should have been longer.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: And well, they could have been shorter on some of the stuff that they didn't need to hear, and they could have been longer on the stuff they actually needed to hear. And the chair at one point, I think, made a comment that you start your answers with respect and...</p> <p>Mr. Milner: It wasn't this committee. That was another one, actually.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: The Home Affairs Committee. Yes. Yes.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: It wasn't the chair. It was actually one of the members. Right. Thank you for correcting me.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: He's no longer an MP. Now, we can go into some of the notes and what they have said. But the point is, all I'm saying to you is, if these facts had come out in 2015, the public could reasonably have asked you, expected you to have done more to make sure the data was no longer with Cambridge Analytica and Dr. C ogan. Yes or no?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I suggest to you, more questions would have been asked of Cambridge Analytica, because we would have made their names public, and Dr. C ogan. So people have asked them directly, prove you no longer have this data.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: That is still not an answer to my question. The fact that questions could have been asked of Cambridge Analytica has got nothing to do with what I'm saying, which is that you, Facebook, would have been expected to have done more, reasonably. Agree?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Yes, given the actions we're now taking.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Thank you. It took us about 10 minutes to get there. Now, let's move on. Now, let's just remind ourselves of some things that your CEO said last night. He said that we also made mistakes, there is more to do, and we need to step up and do it. And CNN's interview says he expressed regret for not doing more to take action against Cambridge Analytica when the issue came to the company's attention in 2015. So there you have an admission that more should have been done. Yes. But you're not able to explain to us, in fact, why more was not done in 2015.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: As I say, I don't want to speculate, but I'm happy to come back to the committee on that.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Thank you. Let's move on to another point, the significance of what you say, user consent. Now, on the 17th of March, your statement last week, you say the claim that this is data breach is completely false. Alexander Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information. Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that govern all developers on Facebook at that time. And in your statement on the 16th, approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it. Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time. This line of reasoning is not new. You accused me of being a lawyer just now.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: Let me... That wasn't an accusation.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: It's a statement. You are, right? You are a lawyer. I am. You still are. I am. I still am.</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I respect that. Thank you.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: Fantastic. I wish I'd done it myself. You do better than most lawyers do. This line of reasoning is not new. Let me give you an example. The law had to deal with these sorts of issues for a long time. I go down, I take a train, I get tickets. There used to be standard forms on these tickets which would remove all liability on the part of the train operator. They can be negligent and I may be left without any recourse. And that's why the law intervened to equalize the position a bit more and refuse the company in a dominant position to deny all liability. It seems to me that the approach you take is very much similar to the approach that many of these utilities and other operators used to take with consumers. The individual versus a large corporation which seeks to deny all liability. Would you accept that simply to say, as you said on the 16th and 17th, \"Oh, you know, they clicked on an app, they must be known to know all the terms and conditions and therefore they agreed.\" That's one position. Really the more acceptable position is the acknowledgment of responsibility that came last night from your CEO and Ms. Sandberg. Would you accept that?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I think the two are entirely consistent.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: You think they're entirely consistent?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I think Mr. Graywall's posts and what we said at the weekend are entirely consistent with what we said, with what Mrs. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have said today.</p> <p>Mr. Shanmugan: So you still do not think that there is some duty on you to make sure that the Facebook users are notified more clearly and protected more vis-a-vis third-party app developers?</p> <p>Mr. Milner: I think your question was a double negative. So just to be really clear, rather than a yes/no, we are absolutely accepting we have a very significant responsibility here. There are legal kind of definitional issues. We do that \u2013 I certainly don't want to get into those with you because I'm sure that you've got a sharper legal mind than mine. We're very clear this is a breach of trust. There is a specific definition under law about what a data breach consequences. One of the questions that we were being asked by journalists was, \"Is this a data breach or not?\" That's what that post was referring to. We've been absolutely clear this was a significant breach of trust with our users and we are determined to address it.
