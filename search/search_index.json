Butane gas lasts for very long, long enough to do a proper hotpot. 1.2kg of meat is somewhat overkill for 4 people - perhaps 800g would have been just nice. Actual water consumption for 2 people was about 4.5L, including washing. There is a functional shower at St John's Island toilet.","title":"9-10 Apr 2022 Lazarus Camping"},{"location":"posts/2022-04-09-lazarus-camping/#lazarus-camping-9-10-apr-2022","text":"View the Googledoc here .
