# Shared Website

The purpose of this website (for now) is mainly to collaborate on development of the trading bot. And maybe other stuff too like the story or something.

It will not be indexed by Google due to the presence of [`noindex` as a meta tag][google-noindex].

A [Github workflow][github-workflow] is set to trigger on pushes to the `master` branch, which will build and deploy the site to [Github Pages][github-pages].
