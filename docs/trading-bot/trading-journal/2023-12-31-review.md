## Learning Points

The trading bot is running well according to the determined strategy, except for an anomaly on 2023-12-29. A rule was in place to prevent duplicate orders on the account. This led to the bot's inability to execute a sell order due to an existing open order. 

Upon closer inspection of the last two trades of the expected performance, if the outstanding opening order had been cleared on 2023-12-30, the sell could have been executed at 167.9425 instead of 169.2545, resulting a significant potential loss of profits.

As a next step, we may have to review and consider removing the existing rule if there are other outstanding open orders.

Despite these challenges, the returns from the bot looks promising even after considering commissions and fees.

## Other notes:

The transaction on 2023-12-21 was ommitted as it may not be representative of the determined strategy.
