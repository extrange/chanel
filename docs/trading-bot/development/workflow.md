# Development Workflow

Workflow Specification - move to README.md. To follow on weekly standup.

## Individual Issues

-   Requirements must be stated clearly
-   If a feature is large, do not split it to multiple issues. Instead, specify it more clearly in terms of subtasks.

## Category Notes

-   Design/Develop
    -   max 1 big item (sub-requirements must be specified clearly)
-   Test
    -   Developers make PRs here. Other developers run tests/check functionalities, and when they approve and merge it moves to Done.
    -   If this was a feature, documentation is also required.

## Standup Steps

1. CLeanup Bugs, Design/Develop and Test categories
2. Reprioritize Backlog
3. Decide next tasks for Design/Develop
