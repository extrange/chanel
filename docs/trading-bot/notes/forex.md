### What is a Pip

-   Forex currency pairs are quoted in terms of pips, short for percentage in points.
-   In practical terms, a pip is one-hundredth of one percent (1/100 x .01) and appears in the fourth decimal place (0.0001).
-   A pip equals one basis point.
-   The bid-ask spread of a forex quote is measured in pips.
-   The Japanese yen is an exception because its exchange rate extends only two decimal places past the decimal point, not four.

### Calculating Pip

-   Assuming forex account is funded with U.S. dollars
-   When the USD is the second of the pair (or the quote currency), Multiply the size of a pip by the trade value. (EURUSD, GBPUSD)
    If you bought 10,000 euros against the dollar at 1.0801 and sold at 1.0811, you'd make a profit of 10 pips or $10.
-   When the USD is the first of the pair (or the base currency), Divide the size of a pip by the exchange rate and then multiply by the trade value. (USDJPY, USDCHF)
    If you bought 100,000 USD against the Canadian dollar at 1.2829 and sold at 1.2830, you'd make a profit of 1 pip or $7.79.
