| D24 (XO)                       | 2024-07-13: Mild taste, with mild alcoholic hints. Notes: Overripe D24.                                                                                       |

| D123 (Chanee)                  | Note: Actually a Thai durian, and often mistaken for MSW because of the thick yellow flesh.                                                                   |

| D197 (Mao Shan Wang)           | 2024-07-12: Really has a 'toasted marshmallow' taste. Note: Raud and Bentong region in Pahang considered the best. Higher quality MSW are sold as Black Gold. |
| D198 (Golden Phoenix/Jin Feng) | 2024-07-xx: Reminiscent of cream puffs                                                                                                                        |
| D200 (Black Thorn)             | 2024-08-24: Not very nice - similar to red prawn but less watery?                                                                                             |
