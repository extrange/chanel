# Woodworking

We went to a furniture making workshop at Tombalek (shared by our friend) and made a small bench (side table)!

## Materials
- **Mahogany**: Used for the bench top, known for its rich color and durability.
- **Beech Wood**: Chosen for the legs due to its strength and stability.

## Equipment

- **Mortiser**: Uses a chisel and bit combination to carve out square holes for joints.
  *Tip*: Check depth and alignment before cutting.
- **Drill Press**: Uses rotating bits to drill holes
  *Tip*: Clamp wood securely and adjust speed for material.
- **Bandsaw**: Cuts larger pieces (e.g., leg supports) accurately.
  *Tip*: Ensure proper blade tension for straight cuts.
- **Router**: Creates curved edges on the bench top.
  *Tip*: Rotate board counterclockwise to avoid kickback.
- **Belt Sander**: Smooths rough edges of the bench top.
  *Tip*: Sand with the grain and progress from coarse to fine grits.
- **Orbital Sander**: Finishes edges and surface.
  *Tip*: Sand at a slight angle to remove deeper marks, then finish flat.

## Bench Making Process

1. **Prepare Wood**: Select grain pattern. We choose the one with circles.
2. **Cut Bench Top**: Use a **Bandsaw** to cut bench top to the desired shape.
3. **Create Insert Holes on legs**: Use the **Mortiser** for precise holes in the leg support.
4. **Create Inserts on Leg Supports**: Using the **Bandsaw**.
5. **Sand Bench Top**: Smooth edges with a **Belt Sander** .
6. **Create Curved Edges**: Use the **Router** for a finished edge.

7. **Smooth Edges**: Use the **Orbital Sander** to finish all surfaces (start with 80-grit, finish with 240-grit).

8. **Drill Leg Holes**: Use the **Drill Press** for accurate leg insert holes.

9. **Assemble Bench**: Attach legs with glue and screws, ensuring alignment and stability.

10. **Apply Finish**: Apply **Linseed Oil** and wipe off excess after 10-20 minutes. This is **Penetrating Oil Finish** and it is best for Natural-looking furniture and floors that need protection without a glossy or shiny finish. However, it requires regular maintenance and reapplication, especially on floors.

## Alternative Wood Finishes

### **For Furniture**:
   **Wax finish, lacquer, shellac, and water-based polyurethane** work well depending on the desired finish and durability needed.

**Water-Based Polyurethane**
   - **Best for**: Floors and furniture where you want to preserve the natural color of the wood.
   - **Pros**: Dries quickly (2-4 hours), low odor, and doesnâ€™t yellow over time.
   - **Cons**: Slightly less durable than oil-based polyurethane, may require more coats.

### **For Flooring**:
   **Oil-based polyurethane, water-based polyurethane, and hardwax oil** are great choices for their durability and protective qualities.

**Oil-Based Polyurethane**
   - **Best for**: Floors and furniture requiring durable, long-lasting protection.
   - **Pros**: Creates a tough, water-resistant finish; adds a warm amber tone.
   - **Cons**: Takes longer to dry (up to 24 hours), may yellow over time, and has a strong odor.

## Bonus: Scratch Repair

We bought a furniture marker to get rid of deep scratch on the wooden parquet floor.
