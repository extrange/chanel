We've been eating sweet potatoes recently and they are easy to make (just bake them plain), taste good, are cheap, and have lots of [health benefits][health].

Through the process we've learnt there are several varieties of sweet potatoes, and all of them taste different.

## Taste

From sweetest to least sweet:

-   Indonesia Honey
-   Beauregard (also known as Australia Gold, not shown here)

    -   This particular variety gets very mushy in the oven, probably better for making sweet potato fries

-   Japan Red and Purple were very close
-   Unknown Japan variety (probably the same as DonDonDonki)

    -   This variety had a more 'fluffy' texture than the rest and felt lighter on the stomach

-   Ipoh
-   Control potato
