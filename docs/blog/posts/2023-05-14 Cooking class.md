Types of flour, from lowest to highest gluten

-   Cake flour
-   Top flour
-   Plain flour
-   Bread flour

Prima and Breadking are the most reliable bread flours. Phoon huat bread flour is not as good.

Fat:

-   Use butter cold
-   SCS butter is apparently quite popular in the older generation
-   Phoon Huat is a good place to get cheap butter
-   Buying a carton of butter is cheaper than individually

Eggs

-   A/AA size eggs generally for tarts
-   for spongy cakes, use AAA eggs
-   Weight without shell:
-   B: 40-45g. Yolk 15g
-   A: 45-50g
-   AA: 50-55g
-   AAA: 55-75g. Yolk 20-23g
-   Egg whites: Largest 40-45g, smallest 35g.
-   On average, an AA egg has 20g egg yolk and 40g egg white

Sugar

-   Use castor sugar for baking (aka granulated sugar)
-   The larger the sugar crystals, the heavier the bake will be, as it holds water.
-   Piped cookies use icing sugar
-   Can use sugar replacement e.g. iLite cook and bake (erythritol/maltitol mix)

Tart Pans

-   Prefer perforated tart rings (don't need to be removed halfway through baking process)

Oven

-   For moist cakes, use conventional oven without fan
-   For tarts, pastries, use fan
