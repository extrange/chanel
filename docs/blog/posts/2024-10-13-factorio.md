# Factorio

Factorio is a fun factory building game, and here are some things we've discovered.

In this post, we consolidate the planets we've completed, and our approaches/checklist for each.

<!-- more -->

## Aquila (TBD)

## Gleba (TBD)

## Vulcanus

??? note "Vulcanus Checklist"

    -   [x] Vulcanus:
        -   [x] Cliff explosives to clear all the cliffs around lava for base rebuild
        -   [x] Mine tungsten carbide to make more foundries
        -   [x] Stone production
        -   [x] Blue circuits
        -   [x] Launch rocket with 1000 metallurgic science packs (for cliff explosives)

We designed this planet's production similarly to a frontend/backend system, with API requirements functioning as a common interface between the two.

### Frontend

Organization:

Products are organized by priority:

-   **Left Side**: Lower quantity items (assemblers, electric poles, foundries)
-   **Right Side**: Scalable production items (circuits)

#### Intermediate Products (we are not interested in)

**Foundry Products:**

-   [x] Copper Coil
-   [x] Iron Gear
-   [x] Iron Stick
-   [x] Low Density Structure
-   [x] Concrete

**Assembler Products:**

-   [x] (mainline) Green Circuits
-   [x] (mainline) Red Circuits
-   [x] (mainline) Blue Circuits
-   [x] Tungsten Carbide

#### Final Products

**Foundry Output:**

-   [x] Pipes
-   [x] Turbo Splitter
-   [x] Turbo Transport belt
-   [x] Turbo Underground belt
-   [x] Foundry
-   [x] Big Mining Drills
-   [x] Metallurgic Science Pack

**Assembler:**

-   [x] Military: Gun Turrets, Bullets
-   [x] Power: Substation/Big Electric Poles
-   [x] Logistics: Construction Bot/Logistics Bot/Roboport/ Explosives
-   [x] Inserters: Bulk/Long
-   [x] Beacon and Productivity/Speed/Quality Modules
-   [x] Rocket Part and Rocket Fuel

### Backend

_Target: 1 turbo belt saturated with 1 line of each item (60/s)_

**Mining:**

-   Coal
-   Calcite
-   Tungsten

**Foundry Operations:**

-   Liquid Iron
-   Liquid Copper
-   Stone â†’ Rails
-   Iron Plates
-   Steel Plates
-   Tungsten Plate

**Processing:**

-   Stone bricks (Furnace)
-   Chemical Products (Refinery/Chemical Factory):
    -   Lubricant
    -   Water
    -   Sulfuric acid
    -   Plastic

### API Requirements (Frontend)

**Notes:**

-   Coal is not necessary since we're not making military science packs.
-   Tungsten plates are only used in metallurgic science packs and turbo logistics so no need to be on the mainline.

**In order of priority:**

Liquids (TBD rates):

-   [x] ~~Liquid Iron~~
-   [x] ~~Liquid Copper~~
-   [x] ~~Water~~
-   [x] ~~Lubricant~~

Solids (60/s each):

-   [x] ~~Iron Plate~~
-   [x] ~~Copper Plate~~
-   [x] ~~Steel Plate~~
-   [x] ~~Plastic~~
-   [x] ~~Tungsten Carbide~~
-   [x] ~~Stone bricks~~
-   [x] ~~Rail~~

## Nauvis

??? note "Nauvis Checklist"

    -   [ ] ~~Nauvis: Redo entire assembly line~~ (unnecessary)
    -   [x] Train System
    -   [x] Resource Production:
        -   [x] Oil mining
        -   [x] Uranium mining
        -   [x] New Copper Source
        -   [x] New Stone Source

        -   [x] Optimized Space Science Pack production
    -   [x] Base Upgrades:
        -   [x] Convert furnaces to electric (monitor power usage)
        -   [x] Blue belts
        -   [x] Assembling machine 3 production
    -   [x] Space Program:
        -   [x] Rocket fuel production
        -   [x] Rocket part production
        -   [x] Space platform production

        -   [x] Spaceship
    -   [x] Logistics:
        -   [x] Requestor boxes
        -   [x] Temporary requestor box for nuclear fuel (pre-kovarex)
    -   [x] Military:
        -   [ ] Nukes

We initially planned to refactor the assembly line here, but seeing that Vulcanus was able to supply much more than Nauvis, we decided to keep the assembly line as is.

For reference in the future, the initial plan is as follows:

### Refactoring Plan

Input lines and intermediate product assembler lines must be expandable on demand.

#### Outputs

-   Science Packs
-   Random items to passive provider chests

#### Inputs

Solids (on mainline):

-   Iron plates
-   Copper plates
-   Steel

Less important solids (feed directly to assemblers needing it):

-   Plastic (red circuit, low density structure)
-   Battery (flying machine frame, lasergun)
-   Sulfur (blue science pack, explosives)
-   Iron ore (concrete)
-   Coal (grenade, explosives)
-   Stone (rail)
-   Bricks
-   U238 (uranium ammo)

Liquid Inputs to supply (build the rest on the spot):

-   Lubricant (flying machine frame, express belts)
-   Sulfuric acid (processing unit)
-   Light oil (rocket fuel)

### Assembly

Prioritize intermediate products (these must be expandable):

-   Low density structure
-   Engine unit
-   Flying machine frame
-   Green/Red/Blue circuits
