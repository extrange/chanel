## Steps
1. Design
2. Clean
3. Slice
4. Print
5. Finish

## Software

- [Tinkercad]: Used for Design and Clean
- [Flashprint], [Cura] : Used for Slice

## File Formats

- STL: Stores basic information about 3D objects using triangles that close a shape by a process called tessellation. Does not preserve color information.
- OBJ: A newer file format that preserves color and texture information on 3D models. Not accepted by all 3D modeling or slicing programs. Uses freeform curves to create contours that STL files cannot.
- 3MF: Has features similar to OBJ files but is written in a more friendly markup language.

## Slicing

1. Select right/left extruder
2. Disable raft and brim
