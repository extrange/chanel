    -   [Scandinavian Oak Wood Storage Bed SOLACE]: $1019 (storage 87x139x33cm/side x2, 87x66x33cm/side x2)

We thought very long and hard about several factors:

-   low-ness of the bed
-   oak
-   storage height
-   storage length
-   headboard slant
-   price
-   soft headboard
-   bed height

We first decided between APERTURE, BASE and SHELTER:

|                              | Pros                                                               | Cons                                                                  |

Then, we decided between BASE and LUNA:

**Chanel's points:**

-   Height space is a key consideration
-   If height is needed: recommends rubber wood option with half lift (safer for heavy bed)
-   If 19cm height is sufficient: recommends LUNA

**Nicholas's points:**

-   Main priorities are storage space and wood quality (oak vs rubberwood)
-   LUNA has advantages:
    -   Made of oak (better quality)
    -   Wider but lower storage space
    -   Less stacking needed
    -   Acceptable trade-off even if suitcases don't fit

However, LUNA does not have a bottom panel, and we went with [Scandinavian Rubber Wood Storage Bed BASE] in the end.
