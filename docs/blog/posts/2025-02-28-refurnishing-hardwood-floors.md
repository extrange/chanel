## Target Areas
1. Area near the window which was water damaged
2. Area under the desk which had signficant weardown

## Materials Needed

- **Orbital Sander**
- **Sandpaper** (60, 80, 120, 220, 320, 400 grit)
- **Wood Finish** Osmo Polyx Satin for $103 (High recommended)
- **Paintbrush**
- **Soft Cloths/Towels**
- **Broom/Duster/Vacuum**
- **Optional: Wood Stain, Lacquer Sealer, Wood Filler, Putty Knife**

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Clean the Floor (Skipped)
Use a pH-neutral floor cleaner to remove dirt and dust.

### 2. Apply Wood Filler (if necessary)
Patch up imperfections with wood filler, then smooth it out with a putty knife.

### 3. Sand the Floor
Start with coarse grit (60 or 80) for deep scratches or old finishes. Gradually move to finer grits (220, 320, 400) for a smooth surface.

### 4. Stain the Floor (Skipped)
If desired, apply wood stain for a richer color before finishing.

### 5. Apply the Finish
Use a paintbrush for edges and a roller for the main area. For a glossy look, apply multiple coats.

### 6. Apply Sealer (Skipped)
Seal the floor for extra protection. Let it dry for a few hours.

## Results

### Key Takeaways

- **Osmos Oil** provides a high-quality finish.
- **Gloss vs. Matte**: Glossy finishes offer more protection, but you can use steel wool for a matte look.
- **Even Sanding** is crucial for consistent color and finish.
- **Clean-up**: Allow the paint-brush that was used for the oil to dry before disposing it.

### Conclusion
Refinishing floors takes time, but the results are worth it! With patience and the right materials, you'll achieve beautiful, durable floors.
