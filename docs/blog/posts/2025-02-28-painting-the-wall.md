We recently painted a 4.5m x 3m wall, and along the way, we learned a lot about preparation, patience, and problem-solving. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the materials, steps, and lessons learned.

## Wall Details
- **Wall Area**: 4.5m x 3m = 13.5m²
- **Paint Coverage**: 1L covers ~8m²

## Materials Needed
- **Paint (5L, Peaceful White)** – $100
- **Paint Set** – $15
- **Paintbrush**
- **Paint Roller**
- **Roller Tray**
- **Plastic Sheet**
- **Painter’s Tape**
- **Optional: Wall Filler**
- **Extension Pole** – $20
- **Putty Knife**
- **Rags/Old T-shirts**

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Prepare the Room
Before diving into the painting, we took the time to cover and move all furniture out of the way. This was crucial to avoid accidental paint spills. Plastic sheets protected the floor, and we taped corners and edges to ensure no unwanted splashes.

### 2. Clean the Wall
We wiped down the wall with a damp cloth to remove dust and grime. After cleaning, we let the wall dry thoroughly before starting.

### 3. Patch Holes
There were a few holes in the wall, so we used wall filler to patch them up. After applying the filler, we used a putty knife to smooth the surface and waited for it to dry before sanding it down.

### 4. Tape Edges
We carefully applied painter’s tape to the edges of the wall, ensuring clean lines around the trim, corners, and ceiling. This step helped avoid messy edges when rolling the paint.

### 5. Prepare the Paint
We stirred the **Peaceful White** paint to ensure it was mixed well and ready for an even application.

### 6. Paint the Edges
Using a paintbrush, we applied the first coat around the edges and corners, being careful to cover every nook and cranny.

### 7. Apply the First Coat
We used a roller to apply the first coat of paint on the wall. We followed the **W or M pattern** to ensure an even coat. After finishing, we allowed the first coat to dry completely before moving on to the second coat.

### 8. Apply the Second Coat
Once the first coat dried, we applied the second coat of paint, which gave the wall a more uniform look. We let it dry for several hours to ensure it was completely set.

### 9. Remove Painter’s Tape
After both coats were dry, we carefully removed the painter’s tape, revealing clean, sharp lines along the edges. We touched up a few areas where the paint might have seeped under the tape.

### 10. Clean Up
Finally, we cleaned our brushes, rollers, and any spills. The room was ready for the final reveal!

## Bonus: Paint Drama

### **The Ceiling Paint Mix-Up**

Before we even started painting, we ordered the wrong ceiling paint. We thought we had ordered our paint paint, but it turned out to be a ceiling paint instead of our desired **Peaceful White**. However, we were able to get a **refund** for the incorrect paint.


### **The Free Paint Twist**

After removing the painter’s tape, we noticed some marks on the other walls, especially where the white ceiling had been splattered with our Peaceful White wall color. In a stroke of luck, we happened upon a newly opening store in Jelita that was still in the process of renovating. As we walked by, we spotted a huge tub of paint and mustered the courage to ask about it. **Chanel** asked the staff if they could spare any, and to our surprise, they offered us some! Meanwhile, **Nicholas** popped over to the newly set-up food court nearby to grab a cup. It was a fortunate and unexpected turn of events—this free paint saved us from having to buy more, and it was exactly what we needed to finish the job.

To fix the splatter marks, we tried a mix of **alcohol wipes, sanding, and kerosene**. However, it wasn’t until we applied the **pure white paint** (from Jelita) that the marks were fully covered. The process wasn’t without its drama—**paint nearly dripped** everywhere during the cover-up—but we managed to salvage the situation just in time.


## Key Takeaways

- **Painter’s Tape**: Absolutely essential for sharp, clean lines.
- **Proper Setup**: Laying down plastic and carefully taping corners made a huge difference in avoiding mistakes.
- **Multiple Coats**: The more coats, the more even and flawless the color. Don’t rush this step.


### Conclusion
Although we faced some hiccups along the way, the end result was worth it. From dealing with a paint disaster to securing free paint, we learned a lot about preparation, problem-solving, and perseverance. Our **Peaceful White** walls and ceiling now look fresh and clean, and we couldn’t be happier with the outcome.
