## Individual Notes

**Chanel**

Chanel has shortlisted the lemon, ginger and nettle tea for late afternoon tea. There are some other tea to be evaluated - more lemons and ginger tea. 

**Nicholas**

- Hibiscus tea is nice cold
- Licorice tea is sweet, however [not for long term consumption][licorice-root]
- Ginger tea is warming
- Lemongrass/lemon myrtle tea is refreshing
- Jasmine green tea seems to **suppress my appetite**
