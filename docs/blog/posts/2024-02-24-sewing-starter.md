Upon certification, we were able to book the sewing machine and materials for our personal projects.

## Simple Lined Tote Bag

-   Pattern [here](../../static/blog/2024-02-24/tote_bag.pdf).
-   **Bagging out:** Stitching pieces right sides together, then when you turn them through the right way, the seam allowance is trapped between the two pieces on the inside so you get a neat finish on your garment.
