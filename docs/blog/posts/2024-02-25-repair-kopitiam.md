# Repair Kopitiam

We volunteered as repair coach for the February Repair Session at RKS@PW@Jurong Lake Gardens.

### 1. Plug

Item 1 was fixed because it works. We suspect it was not working because the power point at the client's house was spoilt.

### 2. Steam Iron
Iron heats up but steam was not produced. Some vault was spoilt. Client was very happy to investigate the issue for 3 hours and was considering buying the parts to fix it.

### 3. Curry Bag
Client gave up by using the scissors. However, gifted repair coach retrieved it from the bin to prove that it can be untangled without using force.

### 4. Rice Cooker
Client returned from lunch to retrieve unfixed rice cooker. 

### 5. Hiking Shoe
Client's hiking shoe was rusted from seawater. Coaches used vinegar and advise client to go Malaysia to install new shoe lace holders.
