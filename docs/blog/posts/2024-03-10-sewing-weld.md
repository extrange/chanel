# Sewing Weld

We booked a second session at Jurong Regional Library for a full day of sewing.

Chanel was stitching with unsecured top threads for a long while before resolving it eventually. She sewed two deformed bags and a pouch with fraying ends on the inside.

Nicholas sewed a button hole and bravely battled the formidable blind stich on Chanel's pants.

## The Aftermath

Bryan watched Chanel and Nicholas leave through the glass doors. He and Rachel packed up the remaining materials, before heading back to his desk and mentally preparing himself to check his inbox, as he usually did at the end of the day. Usually, he had to deal with 'challenges' such as seeking approvals for minor things like $50 budgets for sewing competitions or buying a $20 fabric scissor.

Today, however, was different His eyes widened as he saw the subject of the first email, sent just minutes ago, by his boss.

'Fwd: Hurry up, you slug.'

He clicked and read the body in interest.

'Your position is compromised. Better weld those doors, Massive onslaught approaching'

Onslaught? What was he talking about? Just then, he heard screaming down in the library below. He peeked out of the library, and in the midst of people running and shouting about, he saw a dark-colored beast moving with extreme speed below on the ground level. Doubletime, he thought, as he ran back to the library.

"You looking for a picnic place or what?" asked Rachel, as he quickly rushed in and locked the glass door of the MakeIT room.

"I want those doors sealed NOW!" ordered Bryan, in an uncharacteristically commanding voice, a voice he rarely used to guests of the library. This surprised Rachel.

"Whoa whoa okay. But weld? How? We only have sewing machines," she meekly added.

"Slip stitches. Double slip stitches. Six sleek slip stitches to secure this slippery door securely stealthily," he went on to say perfectly.

Rachel paused, before she understood what he meant. She took pieces of fabric. Then, using a sewing machine, she used the zipper foot to sew a zip. Finally, she tied the fabrics around the door handle and zipped it securely.

"Is the fabric weld gonna hold?" asked Bryan. "Yes," said Rachel.

Chanel was walking with Nicholas to the train station. Suddenly, she heard a growl and turned to see the dark creature looming behind them, having sneaked up. Nicholas panicked and started to run, attempting to grab Chanel. Chanel leaned forward, made a frowning face with a smile, and extended her fists sideways.

The alien looked at her quizzically. It realized it did not have the courage to harm such a cute pout, and stalked off.
