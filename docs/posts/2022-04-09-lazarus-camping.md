Overall notes:

- Campsite A was very noisy at night. However, it is also the only campsite that doesn't have light shining in in the morning.
- Multiple mosquito coils are required to ensure you don't get bitten.
- Butane gas lasts for very long, long enough to do a proper hotpot.
- 1.2kg of meat is somewhat overkill for 4 people - perhaps 800g would have been just nice.
- Actual water consumption for 2 people was about 4.5L, including washing.
- There is a functional shower at St John's Island toilet.
