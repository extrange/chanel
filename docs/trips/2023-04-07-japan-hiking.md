## THOUGHTS & NOTES

Japan is kinda expensive since we have to pay for campgrounds which is $20 per pax and accommodations is like $100 per pax. I am okay to KIV but putting the resources here if we are interested next time. On other hand, there are planned hiking treks that looks really reasonable and cool.
