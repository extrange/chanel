![](/static/2022-09-15/bintan.jpg)

Main idea is to chill and recuperate from city life by the beach.

Tanjung Pinang appears to be the main town, but it is about 1.5 hours away from the resort areas (and the ferry terminal).

### Learning Points

-   Beach quality wasn't so good - it was in a mangrove (though it extended very far out to sea). There was also some oil pollution. For a better, resort-style beach option, a resort facing the east side of Bintan (away from the ferry terminal, and toward the South China Sea) such as [this][ten-rooms], might be a better option.
