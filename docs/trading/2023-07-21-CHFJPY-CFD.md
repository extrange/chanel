# Trading with CHFJPY 8 May - 21 Jul 2023

## Setting Up an IBKR T Reg Margin Account
- Under the Federal Reserveâ€™s Regulation T, investors can borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of securities.
- Minimum deposit for IBKR T Reg Margin Account: 2,000 USD
- Transfer funds to the Fsegment in Account to satisfy maintenance margins.

## Contract For Difference
- A contract for differences (CFD) is a financial contract that pays the differences in the settlement price between the open and closing trades. There is no delivery of physical goods or securities with CFDs.
- There is no ownership of the underlying cost, there is no borrowing or shorting cost.
- CFDs are cash-settled but usually allow ample margin trading so that investors need only put up a small amount of the contract's notional payoff.

## [Commissions](https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/en/pricing/commissions-cfd-forex.php)
Commission: Minimum of USD 2 per order

## [Margins](https://www.interactivebrokers.com.sg/en/index.php?f=4745&p=cfd2)
Since our trading amount is 10,000 CHF (approx. 12,000 USD), we must maintain a minimum initial margin of USD 360. This amount varies depending on the exchange rates.

## Financing Charges
For positions held overnight, IBKR applies a straightforward interest credit or charge based on the difference in the benchmark rates for the two currencies and a low IB spread.

Based on the live run, the average financing cost per day is 10 JPY & 150 JPY for a long and short position respectively.

## Our Performance
- Period: 8 May to 21 Jul (11 Weeks)

We launched the live automated trading system on 8 May and consolidated the results after 11 weeks on 21 Jul. There were a total of 17 trades and we made a profit of 34,000 JPY (approx 240 USD).

| Trades | Realised P/L | Commission (USD) | Financing Fees (JPY)| 
| --- | --- |---| --- | 
| 17 |  34,369.86 | -44 | -5,501|

The trading system was executed in three distinct phases with different strategies in each phase.

| Phase | Strategy| Start Date - End Date| 
| --- |---| --- | 
| 1 | SMA APO (n=30, n_multiplier=3, n_apo_slope=0) | 8May-3Jun (4 weeks) |
| 2 | KAMA (n=30, n_multiplier=4, lt_n=190, lt_std=27, st_std=70)| 3Jun-28Jun (4 weeks) |
| 3 | BEST (n=30, n_multiplier=3, lt_n=150, lt_std=10, st_std=60)| 29Jun-21Jul (3 weeks) |

### Phase 1: SMA APO
- Period: 8May-3Jun (4 weeks)
- Strategy: SMA APO (n=30, n_multiplier=3, n_apo_slope=0)

| Trades | Realised P/L  | Financing Fees | 
| --- |---| --- | 
| 1 |  -24,300 (-1.6%)  | 3,972|

Due to technical issues, the strategy was not executed properly. It executed only 1 trade even though based on backtesting, it should have executed 24 trades. This was due to the market subscription breaking due to errors. As a result, the engine did not receive any bar updates and the strategy was not executed. This problem was subsequently resolved in the next phase.

### Phase 2: KAMA
- Period: 3Jun-28Jun (4 weeks)
- Strategy: SMA APO (n=30, n_multiplier=3, n_apo_slope=0)

| Trades | Realised P/L | Financing Fees (JPY)| 
| --- |---| --- | 
| 15 |  31,200  | ~1,400 |

The strategy performed well at the start, recording a gain of JPY 44,850 (2.9%). However, it started recording small consecutive losses which wiped the initial gain. This is due to sudden whipsaws and noise in the data. Hence, a new strategy that is more stable was explored in the Phase 3.

### Phase 3: BEST
- Period: 29Jun-21Jul (3 weeks)
- Strategy: BEST (n=30, n_multiplier=3, lt_n=150, lt_std=10, st_std=60)

| Trades | Realised P/L | Financing Fees (JPY)| 
| --- |---| --- | 
| 1 |  27,469.86 (1.7%) | ~200|

The new strategy is less reactive and holds positions over longer periods. The comparison of the three strategies is described in the next section.

## Evaluation of Models

### Overall
For the entire duration from 8May to 21Jul, the BEST strategy outperforms the rest and is the only one that beat the buy and hold strategy though by a small 0.03%.

###  Phase 1
During phase 1, SmaApo performed very well. However, in the subsequent phases, it resulted in significant losses. It is not as consistent as the other strategies.

###  Phase 2
In Phase 2, SmaApo's performance fell to the bottom and the BEST's performance improved significantly. This is probably due to losses suffered during the flat ranging market in the first 2 weeks of June which the strategy could not handle.

###  Phase 3
In Phase 3, only the BEST strategy recorded a gain. The remaining two strategies suffered losses.
