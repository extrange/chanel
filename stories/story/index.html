<p><em>Mm since I'm stuck in a bunk with 9 other people and intermittent access to internet I'll write about my schedule.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a big metal ship which has very squeezy bunks. At present I'm in a room about 4m x 5m with 9 people, we have 3 triple bunks. The mattress is maybe 70cm x 1.8m. We just had a briefing at 1030pm, and our schedule for tomorrow is waking up at 7am and then breakfast, and then cleaning. Then at 1pm there's some safety briefing and then a tour of the ship, and then dinner and that's it. Laptop use is officially not allowed but one guy told me not to care. I don't have internet on the bunk so I can write uninterrupted. Maybe I'll have better inspiration tomorrow to write more interesting stuff. I didn't manage to read much today. Good night chanel</em></p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-an-unexpected-series-of-events">Chapter 1: An unexpected series of events</h2>
<p>Nicholas settled and nestled himself on his narrow bunk, stretching as much as possible to make use of the full real estate that he has been given. <em>This was just the beginning,</em> he thought, as he settled into some good night's rest.</p>
<p>He found himself floating in space. As he floated and crossed into a transparent field, he felt an odd sensation that his body has enter into a different territory and woke up.</p>
<p>He picked up his new samsung M22 which woke him up to check the time.</p>
<p>"WELCOME TO XENON EARTH ZONE 5492" greeted him on his phone screen. He looked around him and realised that he was not the only one who received the odd message.</p>
<p>It was 1pm and the 9 men shuffled to the ship deck. Instead of the standard blue, they met violet tinted skies and seas. The originally yellow lamp is now burning a bright violet.</p>
<p>The captain of the ship arrived with a circular black metal looking device floating behind him.</p>
<p>"As you all have noticed, we are in Xenon Earth Zone 5492. Here, we have been blessed with Xenon particles - the violet hue in the atmosphere. They were first discovered in 2000s and we have been researching them since.</p>
<p>As you are exposed to the xenon particles, your mind and body will be able to think and work at superior levels. This has resulted in technology advancing at a much faster pace here than the rest of the world.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, AI Jemma will give you a tour of the ship and test your body's acclimatisation to the xenon environment."</p>
<p>The circular device glowed purple and begin to speak.</p>
<p>"This is the flight deck, where we launch robotic probes to test the atmosphere."</p>
<p><em>Looks like an Amazon Echo</em>, Nicholas thought. <em>Also why would Xenon, a noble, unreactive element, affect our thoughts?</em></p>
<p>Nicholas walked to the edge of the ship and looked at the water, tinted a deep violet by the sunset. The sea seemed to stretch into infinity; there was nothing but water, water and more water.</p>
<p>"We will now begin the acclimatization test. The deck will be negatively charged, initiating fusion of Xenon-331 nanoparticles with the human epidermis. You might get a mild tingling sensation - please be assured this is normal".</p>
<p>At first nothing happened. The sea breeze seemed to stay the same, the crashing of the waves against the ship continued. The air seemed to shimmer a bit - was this a product of the imagination?</p>
<p>Nicholas began to feel a tingling in his leg, which gradually spread throughout his body, increasing further and further in intensity. Simultaneously, he began to think faster and faster, numbers and equations appearing of their own accord, his vision beginning to narrow further and further until his mind was consumed by a vast, inky darkness that seemed to span the Universe itself.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-inappropriate-attraction">Chapter 2: Inappropriate attraction</h2>
<p><em>"...I wouldn't be too worried. After all some people can't even land on the planet."</em></p>
<p><em>"If... Okay fine. Let's check on him later. Oh wait no - I think he's waking up. "</em></p>
<p><em>"Alright, check him and then get him back to the ship."</em></p>
<p><em>How crude, telling me to "check him",</em> thought Chanel, as she keyed in the commands for radiation levels into the omniscanner. She had a brief thought about quitting, but decided that her bond with the Department of Extrasolar Analysis and Defence wasn't worth paying off.</p>
<p>The patient under her care stirred.</p>
<p>"Where am I?"</p>
<p>"Oh great, you are awake. It is not everyday that we have a new recruit fainting from Xenon overdose."</p>
<p>Chanel swiveled her chair to take a look at her patient. She already knew he had handsome face but still found herself captivated by his deep black eyes.</p>
<p>"We are at the clinic set up by the Department Extrasolar Analysis and Defence. Since you fainted, we will have to run an onmiscan to check if everything is okay before sending you back to the ship."</p>
<p>She led him to the omniscanner and as she laid him down, she leaned in abit closer, taking in his warm skin.</p>
<p>The machine started beeping slowly before suddenly ringing incessantly. The radiation chart readings touched the thresholds and then went off the limits of the monitor.</p>
<p><em>How can that be possible?! It seems that his body has a high compatibility with the Xenon particles. We will have to keep him here and check him for a few more days,</em> Chanel thought as she looked at Nicholas. <em>He has pretty good features.</em> When she touched his arms earlier, they were pretty well toned. His lips also looked soft and supple. <em>It definitely would be a good idea to keep him here,</em> she thought.</p>
<p>Confused at why he was being stared at, Nicholas broke the silence.</p>
<p>"Am I okay?"</p>
<p>"Oh! oh yeah yes, you will be fine! It seems like you are suited for life here given your body readings. Ill have to update the higher ups of your results. But before that, I'll be asking you some questions."</p>
<p>Embarrassed, she started scribbling down notes on the patient's report and ran through the standard procedural questions.</p>
<p>"Now that is out of way. I am sure you have many questions of your own?"</p>
<p>"Am I dead?"</p>
<p>"Does this look like hell to you? No, nonono," the girl in the flowy black, lacy dress shook her head repeatedly and chuckled, her laughter tinkling in the air. Her short, neatly trimmed black hair blended in with the dress, making it seem as if she was wearing a full body suit. She was facing him expectantly with both hands on her lap, her manicured nails reflecting the sterile white lighting of the medical bay. "You just experienced a mind jump. Ever had a time you thought you felt smart?"</p>
<p>Nicholas opened his mouth in reply, but the girl silenced him with another laugh, her dimples visible.</p>
<p>"My apologies, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Chanel, the chief scientist of the ship." She stood up and extended her hand. Her hands were tiny and soft, but she had a firm grip.</p>
<p>"Xenon microparticles are a relatively new discovery, so we don't fully know what they do. We do know that when exposed to electronic circuits, they allow much more computational capability, and we use them to build AI. Jemma is an example."</p>
<p>"We guessed that on humans it should be similar, and that's what we're seeing with mind jumps, which are the microparticles causing an individual to think at superhuman speeds. There are however other strange effects, which I'll leave for another day."</p>
<p>"If you're feeling better, I'd like to get you back on deck."</p>
<p>She supported him as he sat up, and as her hair brushed his face he caught her scent, which reminded him of lavender flowers in a midsummer's field.</p>
<p>Nicholas exited the clinic, his mind still active with questions. <em>What was Xenon Earth, and why was he here?</em> He recalled being on a ship, for some vague, overseas military exercise, and having a general feeling of dejectedness and boredom. He partly recalled having to wake up early and eat a grubby, high glycemic index breakfast, but yet now he was on a foreign ship and even planet altogether. And who was this lady at the clinic? She seemed familiar, yet so different...</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the scene in front of him.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-starry-starry-night">Chapter 3: Starry starry night</h2>
<p>Glittering amethyst petals fell from the sky like blooming cherry blossoms on a windy day. When they touch the metal deck, the petals faded into a magenta glow.</p>
<p>Nicholas stretched out his hand to catch one of the falling petals. It melted into his palm and he felt a tingling warm sensation.</p>
<p>On the ship deck, machinery and cargo were bustling about and numerous AI Jemmas were managing the coordination. They must be preparing for a big expedition. At the edge of the deck, the vast ocean revealed itself against a backdrop of a million stars.</p>
<p>The surreal beauty of the falling amethysts and sparkling night sky awakened Nicholas' feelings of sublime and holy. He sighed in awe and felt that he had found the door to the universe and beyond. The question now was whether he was ready to open it.</p>
<p>He shivered at the thought and took a look at the paper report he was given.</p>
<p><em>Patient experienced a mind jump and was brought in unconscious. Pulse was accelerated but out of the danger zone. Final readings of the omniscan has indicated that his body has completed the acclimisation of Xenon. Patient verbalised some confusion and discomfort of his situation. Advise team captain to keep watch and to have a follow up after his first mission.</em></p>
<p>He smiled and slipped the paper into his pocket. One of the purple Amazon Echo thing made a beeline towards him.</p>
<p>"Welcome back Nicholas, I am AI Jemma 872 and I have been assigned to guide you in your journey."</p>
<p>"Why am I here?"</p>
<p>"Well, you have been selected to go on a mission with a team of 5. They have discovered a new novae zone in the Ocean. You will have to dive underwater to investigate the area for other life forms."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Oh right, you have not been programmed. Allow me to update your memory with information of this zone."</p>
<p>The AI floated to face Nicholas and a sent a stream of bits into his mind.</p>
<p>Captain's Log</p>
<p>12:25am, 16 Sept 2022<br/>
<em>Low Earth Orbit</em><br/>
<em>Captain's Cabin, Space Shuttle</em><br/>
The flight from Earth was emotional for many of the crew. To leave their families and loved ones behind for 21 days and put their lives on the line...I would not expect that of anyone. We selected the crew - we only took those without family commitments. The last glimpse of Earth from the windows of the shuttle was a teary moment for many of them. Also, most of the crew have not been acclimatized to Xenon.</p>
<p>3:44pm, 17 Sept 2022<br/>
<em>200km from Warp Point Delta</em><br/>
<em>Captain's Cabin, Space Shuttle</em><br/>
Approach to the Warp Point was uneventful. Most of the crew are sleeping. We will proceed as planned. Travel in warp space brings strange dreams...I wonder what I will get this time.</p>
<p>8:15am, 18 Sept 2022<br/>
<em>Low orbit around Xenon Earth, Constellation 5492</em><br/>
<em>Bridge, Space Shuttle</em><br/>
I am one of the few left on board, the rest have landed. Acclimatization has started. The gamma ray monitors have started spiking...the Phenomenon is starting again. We will need our best minds for this.</p>
<p><em>help...is anyone out there... unidentified creature approaching...ship control...lost, we need evac...images of flippers, of huge creatures underwater, tentacles, sharp teeth, a bright flash of light, then darkness...a feeling of calmness, of oneness with everything...</em></p>
<p>And then static.</p>
<p>Nicholas shook his head. He seemed to stagger slightly, but quickly regained his balance.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-the-dive">Chapter 4: The Dive</h2>
<p>"Now, this way please," the floating AI chirped. It flew closer to the edge of the deck, toward a section without railings.</p>
<p>"Wait!" Nicholas heard a familiar voice shout.</p>
<p>A girl wearing a black dress in ran across the ship deck and grabbed Nicholas' hand and shoved a small red pill into it.</p>
<p>"I forgot to pass you this! It will help calm your nerves and ease your brand new active mind. It is also packed with bioactive peptides that will intensify your muscle protein synthesis which I thought..."</p>
<p>She paused to take a breath and looked up to meet his eyes. Smiling sheepishly, she continued.</p>
<p>"I thought.. would be something you'd like."</p>
<p>Nicholas mused at the petite girl looking at him with such expectant eyes. At least a hundred possible replies crossed his mind but he could only come out with a thank you.</p>
<p>"Well, I won't hold you back any longer! Have fun on your mission and I'll see you in a bit!"</p>
<p>She looks like a small field mouse scurrying back to her nest on this violet snowy day. Nicholas rolled the pill in his hand before popping it into his mouth. It tasted slightly sweet.</p>
<p>Feeling calmer from the effects of the pill, he settled into the dive capsule. Designed by ASPACEW, the capsule E22 was completely transparent and fitted with the latest navigation technology, capable of reaching depths of up to 55,800 feet and pressures of over 21,000 pounds per square inch.</p>
<p>The engine whirred to life and capsule descended into the deep ocean.</p>
<p>The first impression Nicholas got of the foreign sea was that of vastness. As soon as the capsule was lowered into the water, all 270 degrees of the entire spherical viewport were plunged into an unfathomable darkness. As his eyes adjusted, he began to see small, sparkling multicolored lights slowly descending. Some were violet, some purple, and after a while he realized them to be the petals he had seen on the surface, falling gently into the alien ocean. As each fell deeper, it began to dim, until it was consumed by the depths.</p>
<p>As he descended, the light from the petals began to fade, until there was just a wall of dark, with only the blue glow of the communications panel remaining. He stared into the abyss, half expecting something to jump at him. But there was nothing. Just silence, and the quiet hum of the ion repulsion motors on board. He thought about the whole affair, the strangeness of the situation, how he was on a foreign planet, plucked out of his day programming job on Earth, for what was supposed to be a routine, boring military training exercise, and now tossed into what seemed like an alternate reality.</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the communicator cackling to life. A chirpy female voice began speaking.</p>
<p>"Hello here, I'm Tricia, your executive officer or XO for short. I'll be assisting you through this mission."</p>
<p>XO? Assistant? He wondered.</p>
<p>"Let's turn on the night vision first, um er lemme see...I think this should be it!"</p>
<p>He heard a click, and immediately the area in front of him brightened up considerably. He could make out towers of rock, with canyons stretching as far as the eye could see. At the foot of a rock formation he could make out what appeared to be shore with waves. <em>Underwater? How was this possible?</em></p>
<p>"So I was told to take you this way, but that's boring, I hate rules y'know, so let's go somewhere more fun," she piped somewhat enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"My boss Chanel told me to guide you toward the left, that's where the previous expedition ended, but I heard rumors that the crew on the last craft that went to the right had some seriously strange things happen to them. Your choice!"</p>
<p>On the left, two towers of rock rose at a slant and met each other, forming a sort of gate. Beyond the gate, visibility was poor. On the right, a huge wall of rock blocked any passage, but there appeared to be a circular hole in the lower part of the formation, which seemed just large enough for the craft.</p>
<p>Nicholas stared at both directions in turn, contemplating where to head next.</p>
<p>It would be crazy to go left as Nicholas recalled the captain's last memo. On the other hand, there is no information on the right. He calculated the probabilities, evaluated the potential scenarios and reasoned with himself. The lure of the unknown pulled at his heart and one cannot deny a man's passion for adventure and his survival instincts.</p>
<p>"Let's go right."</p>
<p>"Right it is! I will send the exact coordinates to you now. Oh and don't worry, this craft is specially made to withdstand immense forces. " Tricia piped through the speakers and three set of numbers appeared on the instrument panel.</p>
<p>After accepting the new coordinates, a thin thread of blue light launched from the craft, leading him through the creak, lighting up the path and showing him the way.</p>
<p>Nicholas held the wheel and steered it gently towards the right. The auto mode disengaged immediately and he was now in full control of his fate.</p>
<p>With surprising ease, he guided the craft through the narrow creak and followed the blue line. The information transfer earlier had imbued in him knowledge and skills that he never had before.</p>
<p>A road of pale moody dull sand approached him endlessly. As time passed, the feeling of dread and regret creeped in. <em>Is there an end in this? What is at the end of the thread?</em> Perhaps it was not a good idea to go this way. He could be meeting the rest of the crew right now but he wanted to meet with singularity instead. Before he could rotate the craft, everything went red.</p>
<p>"WARNING! Fast approaching object!"</p>
<p>In three flashes, a green dot appeared on the radar screen and teleported itself from the edge to the center. Even with his enhanced senses, Nicholas could not react.</p>
<p>Directly in front, an E22 capsule drifted toward them. The capsule looked derelict, with deep gashes across the glass surface, disfiguring the ASPACEW logo. The entire capsule was dark, and its headlights were turned off. The dead hunk of glass and metal enlarged as it approached on a collision course.</p>
<p>To his surprise, instead of panicking, Nicholas felt a strange sense of calmness flowing over him. <em>To die in every moment; that is life. Just to sit, that is all.</em> Where did those thoughts come from? Was it the pill Chanel gave him?</p>
<p>Instead of hitting the emergency force field generator as he was about to initially, Nicholas closed his eyes and breathed deeply, fully letting the tension of the present situation fill his mind, and observed it, without fear or craving. If this was how his life were to end, in an unknown sea, on a foreign planet, far away from anyone he knew...so be it. He opened his eyes seconds later, just before impact...</p>
<p>The lifeless hulk of metal and glass surged forward, making contact with his capsule's glass bubbler. To his surprise, there was no crash, sound or impact. The entire capsule passed soundlessly through the glass. As the ghostly apparition continued through his body, he felt an icy chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>The entire capsule remained silent for a few seconds, the hum of the ion drive gone.</p>
<p><em>"...static...Nicholas...contact...emergency...activate rescue vessels... unidentified object"</em></p>
<p>Tricia's voice crackled intermittently over the communications channel. Abruptly, the engines restarted, seemingly of their own accord. The craft continued forward, toward the circular hole in the rock wall in front.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-things-are-not-what-they-seem">Chapter 5: Things Are Not What They Seem</h2>
<p>Back in the lab, Chanel concluded her latest experiment - The Effects of Xenon Microparticles on the Spotted Field Mouse. She had chosen this particular species of mouse for its hardiness in various environments. That was the reason she told everyone who asked her. In reality, she chose it because she had found such a mouse nibbling at her leg one day when she was sleeping in the field back on earth.</p>
<p>It was a long, tiring day for her, and Chanel yearned for rest. Her right hand absentmindedly stroked the inner side of her thigh, making her shiver involuntarily.</p>
<p>She thought of the young handsome patient she met last evening. When she guided him to the omniscanner, she resisted the urge to climb onto the bed with him. She would have pushed him down against the cold hard scanner and kissed his soft warm lips.</p>
<p>Her hand slipped further up as she let her desires and imaginations lead her. But before she could play out the rest of the scene, Tricia bursted into the lab.</p>
<p>Startled but quick to react, Chanel straightened her dress and hid her annoyance of being interrupted.</p>
<p>"What brings you here?"</p>
<p>"Nicholas! We lost contact with him after he decided to explore the Celipo temple!"</p>
<p><em>The fool! How could he go there!</em></p>
<p>Done with her duty, Tricia walked to the back of the ship, the clacking of her high heels disturbed the quiet night. Under the cover of darkness, she relieved herself from her humanly ornaments. Her lips curled in satisfaction and her eyes turned pitch black. A lizard-like tail grew from her silhouette and webs filled the gaps between her fingers. She slipped under the railings and dived into the sea.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6-ancient-temple">Chapter 6: Ancient Temple</h2>
<p>Back under the water, the craft passed through the hole and found itself in the middle of a circular enclosure. Surrounded by high walls and being closed off at the top, the place gave Nicholas a feeling of security. He felt protected from all sides.</p>
<p>The hum of engines died down, respecting the sacredness of this temple. A sense of serenity washed over Nicholas over and over again like the perpetual waves on the beach. He calmly inspected the area and noticed that the walls were inscribed with alien langauge.</p>
<p><em>To realize pure mind in delusion is the immutable truth.</em><br/>
<em>For the Soto race, sand is treasure.</em><br/>
<em>And no trace shall be left behind.</em><br/></p>
<p>The words glowed violet and the sand below him begin to shift. The entrance that was supposed to become the exit disappeared instead. Nicholas was trapped.</p>
<p><em>Trapped!</em></p>
<p>Nicholas surveyed his surroundings, looking for an exit. Apart from the headlamps of his craft, the only other source of illumination was the pale violet glow of the words on the walls. <em>Soto race? Sand is treasure?</em></p>
<p>Abruptly, the glowing words began to dim and fade. The walls of the cave became darker and darker, swallowing light hungrily, until even the craft's high wattage headlamps shone on pure darkness. He was completely alone in the void.</p>
<p>After sitting in the quiet darkness for a few minutes, he became aware of a faint violet light above him. He looked up.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the cave seemed to have disappeared. In its place he saw instead an intricate pattern of lines, slowly shifting. There were smaller patterns of concentric circles and dots seemingly scattered at random among the pattern of lines. With a flash of almost inhuman insight, surprising even himself, he realized that he was staring at a star map, but one of galactic proportions. The map slowly panned, and one pattern of three dots started glowing more intensely - he recognized that as the constellation Orion. As he continued looking, he was able to make out Cassiopeia, Bootes and Aquila.</p>
<p>The immensity of the map astounded him, for he realized that the civilization must have mastered astronomy, space travel and possibly even warping in order to construct such a map.</p>
<p>Just as he began to make out a familiar looking dot with 9 others orbiting it, the star map faded away. In its place, a caricature of a creature with a lizard-like tail and human features appeared, and at the same time he was filled with a vague uneasiness. This image flashed thrice before dissolving into blackness.</p>
<p>The cave walls slowly materialized back. However, the words on the walls had changed.</p>
<p><em>From sand we arise,</em><br/>
<em>And back to sand is our demise.</em><br/>
<em>Just to sit is all there is,</em><br/>
<em>But if you must stand, then realize this,</em><br/>
<em>Be careful of what seems familiar,</em><br/>
<em>Your friends may not be what they appear.</em><br/></p>
<p>As he pondered over the meaning of the alien poem, his eyes caught a dim ray of light to his side. The entrance to the cave had reappeared!</p>
<p>He turned the craft and sped through the narrow tunnel, back to the desert of moody sand. Curiously, he half noticed webbed footprints in the sand, but did not pay any further attention to it. Above, the multicolored shower of Xenon petals continued noiselessly.</p>
<p>He thought about the alien warning, and pondered whether to ask Chanel for advice, or continue his mission of finding the Novae zone.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7-forbidden-love">Chapter 7: Forbidden Love</h2>
<p>A human-sized reptilian creature crawled out from the sand. Realising that the temple was empty, a low growl enamated from her throat. <em>How did he escape?</em> She quickly scanned the area and spotted the exit tunnel.</p>
<p>Alerted by the radar scanner, Nicholas looked up and from a distance, he saw the same creature in the caricature! This must be the other lifeform that he was to discover in his mission!</p>
<p>When their eyes met, the creature spoke.</p>
<p>"Follow me."</p>
<p>Her call was like a seductive siren, deep, sultry and strangely enticing. She turned and swam towards the towers of rock on the left.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Nicholas followed behind. If this were the Soto race that constructed the map, he could learn their intelligence and even discover space travel and warping! Excited at the prospect of space travel, he did not consider the potential dangers that he could be getting into.</p>
<p>After a series of twists and turns, they arrived at an other-worldly underwater cave system. Centuries of waves had carved the rocks into a complex labyrinth of chambers. Some had rivers while others had waterfalls. Some had glowing shades of purple, yellow and teal while others were completely dark.</p>
<p>The caves were surrounded by towering stalagmites and colossal mushrooms of stone. Awed by the extraordinary formations, Nicholas quickly realized he was in a new, vast world, full of life and filled with mysteries.</p>
<p>As the craft approached the shore, the headlamps shone at the creature. He could finally see her clearly. She was more human than he had imagine. The only thing alien about her face was that her eyes were filled with eerie darkness. In contrast, she had her hazel brown hair tied up into two neat round buns giving her an innocent appearance.</p>
<p>She stood there completely exposed, waiting for him to disembark. Emerald green skin covering her entire body glimmered wetly under the bright light. Her round, conical breast were streaked with the salt of the sea. In between her thighs, her slippery tail swished gently side to side. He was not sure where to look.</p>
<p>He also could not concentrate when she shared the history of her kind. However, he understood that they needed his help in exchange for something he desires. Thoughts of lust and fear corrupted his mind, poisoning his rationality.</p>
<p>After walking for some time, they stopped at narrow passageway. She shifted her body to face his and Nicholas found himself lost in a pair of mesmerising supernatural black holes. The distance between them closed and he was suddenly aware of the softness of her cold wet body.</p>
<p>"Mm, so handsomeeee," her voice trailed off as she placed both her hands on his shoulders, tilting her hips seductively toward him.</p>
<p><em>Where had he heard that voice?</em></p>
<p>He kept silent, forcing his body not to react. However, her lascivious demeanor stirred an aching need deep within him, and he could feel his manhood begin to stiffen, pressing into her thigh as she ran her hands down his chest.</p>
<p><em>She's not even human! Stop thinking about her!</em></p>
<p>He prayed she didn't notice, as he tried to turn away, but to no avail.</p>
<p>"Oooh, look who's getting excited," she said as her hands roamed seductive down his body, toward his groin, making him draw in a deep breath of desire.</p>
<p><em>This voice - he had heard it before!</em></p>
<p>With a startling sense of realization he snapped out of his trance in half terror. <em>This was Tricia, the XO guiding him previously! Was she an alien?</em></p>
<p>In panic he stepped back, breaking her sensuous embrace. He moved his hand to the laser pistol at his waist. Before he could draw the gun and fire, the creature that had previously been Tricia disappeared down the narrow corridor, and when he reached the bend there were only webbed footsteps.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8-caring-parents">Chapter 8: Caring Parents</h2>
<p>Back on the ship, Chanel concluded her last experiment for the day. It was getting late at night, and she headed back to her cabin.</p>
<p>"You have a new message from Mum." Jemma's disembodied voice announced.</p>
<p>"Read," she said while slipping over to the shower.</p>
<p><em>Dear Chanel, how has your trip been? Has everyone been treating you well? I've fed Tammy lots of treats as you told me, and I now fear he may be getting too fat and outgrow his cage.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I miss you - I know this was a career you decided for yourself, knowing you'd be away from family and all, but you've been telling me you've always wanted to be an astro-scientist from young. I remember how you used to arrange rice grains in the shape of our solar system on the rare nights we ate rice. And now you're on another planet!</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, and by the way I've decided to move house. The sum that Dad left us behind is more than enough for a decent apartment, and you should get your own room already instead of sharing the tiny room with me as though you're still 5. Besides, what else am I going to spend the money on?</em></p>
<p><em>Happy spacing!</em></p>
<p>Chanel was still getting used to her mum writing letters to her, a rarity back on Earth. She smiled as she tucked herself into bed, the sky overhead raining violet petals slowly.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9-lost-without-fried-chicken">Chapter 9: Lost, without fried chicken</h2>
<p>Replacing the petals were amethyst gems decorating the cave ceilings. Under their ethereal glow laid a young man resting his back against the cave walls. Beads of sweat on his hair and forehead glistened like the precious stones. The cave echoed his deep steady breaths giving him some sort of reassurance but he furrowed his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Opening his eyes to admire the ceiling of stars, Nicholas wondered how did he end up here. He had chased the webbed footprints for hours before exhuastion caught up to him. When he stopped to steady himself, he was suddenly aware of the ache in his muscles, the pounding in his head and the emptiness of his stomach. Overwhelmed with fatigue, he knew he had to turn back.</p>
<p>He tried to trace his way back but as expected of his poor sense of direction, he was lost. After wandering for some time, he decided to squeeze himself into an inconspicuous crevasse to hide and rest in.</p>
<p>His stomach growled in anger. The last real food he had was some plain oats doused in unsweetened soy milk. Ever since he watched the documentary on the half-ton killer, he vowed to eat healthy. He spent months researching and experimenting before crafting his ultimate diet regime.</p>
<p>There was no negotiation even when eating with others. He was dedicated and loyal man to his diet. However, in the void of his stomach, he regretted it all. He would consume the entire universe of crispy fried chicken, his weakness and treasure.</p>
<p>Although he held a face of impassivity whenever he walked past the fast food chain, his insides were in turmoil. He imagined biting into juicy succulent chicken encased in a layer of crispy deep fried batter. He would savour its sweetness and tenderness with undertones of sin and hate.</p>
<p>A vibration from his watch pulled him back to reality. The low battery warning reminded him of how he was also drained in energy. From the corner of his eyes, he noticed he had connection. Two flickering bars. It was weak but it had hope. He fiddled with his communication device and to his joy, he found a send help function.</p>
<p><em>Coordinates sent to main ship.</em></p>
<p>Pleased with his accomplishment, he relaxed and allowed his unconscious mind to take over. The violet glow of the gems faded.</p>
<p>In darkness, piles and piles of sand fell onto him, enveloping and paralyzing him. He summoned all his strength and strained every nerve to free himself but he was held in place. Frozen in stone, he waited. Like a grain of sand, he felt impalpable, insubstantial, insignificant. He kept on waiting until, he heard footsteps getting louder and louder.</p>
<p>It was the sound of approaching footsteps!</p>
<p>Nicholas was jolted wide awake. Grabbing his laser pistol, he crouched next to entrance, ready to defend himself against any incoming threat.</p>
<p>In the silent darkness of the early morning, Chanel's watch beeped softly, pulling her from her soft, sweet dreamworld.</p>
<p>"Priority one distress signal received. Location omega two-two-alpha. Subject name: Nicholas".</p>
<p><em>Nicholas?</em> She jolted upright in bed and rubbed her large, sleepy eyes with her tiny hands.</p>
<p>"Jemma, locate his exact position. Prepare another diving unit ASAP"</p>
<h2 id="chapter-10-corruption">Chapter 10: Corruption</h2>
<p>"Nicholas? Are you there?" Chanel's voice rang out from a distance, echoing in the cave.</p>
<p><em>Chanel? How did she know he was here?</em></p>
<p>"I know you're here, come out. You must be feeling hungry, I brought fried chicken for you," she cooed.</p>
<p>Her footsteps picked up pace, headed directly toward him. As his eyes acclimatized to the darkness, he could see a dim silhouette, about fifteen meters away. He opened his mouth to shout in reply, but at the last moment, a deep instinct in him got the better of him and he covered his mouth.</p>
<p>Looking around, he saw above him was a narrow ledge, which he could just fit into. He quickly jumped into the ledge and hid himself.</p>
<p>The silhouette became clearer and he saw a female figure walk toward him. From this distance, he recognized her as Chanel. She wasn't wearing the black dress he saw previously, however.</p>
<p>Instead, she was wearing a tight, body hugging red tube top, which accentuated the curves of her hips and round buttocks. Her cleavage was much more prominent, the tightness of the tube top squeezing her round melons together. She carried a plastic bag in her right hand.</p>
<p>"Where are you? I don't like playing games, you know."</p>
<p>Nicholas held his breath as she continued walking, until she was right below him. He took the opportunity to look at her closely. Her skin was shiny as if she had just taken a shower, but also completely bare, without any trace of hair. Her nails were manicured, shining red under the dim light of the cave.</p>
<p>She continued walking, but abruptly stopped at where he was sitting previously, right below him. She seemed to be confused, or surprised, as she looked around.</p>
<p>"Aww, hiding? Don't want to come out and play with me? I know you've been looking at me," she said, while moving her hands seductively toward her hips.</p>
<p>How did she know that?</p>
<p>She looked around the cave, and then stopped. Almost mechanically, she slowly started tilting her head upward, right toward where he was hiding, right until she made direct eye contact with him.</p>
<p>"Found you!"</p>
<p>Nicholas shrieked in terror and jumped, as two black lifeless orbs that stood for the eyes of the creature in front of him stared into his soul. His gun clattered uselessly to the floor, out of his reach.</p>
<p>Morphing into her true self, a sinister smile spread across her face, taking delight in seeing her frightened and helpless prey. She twisted her neck in the most horrifying manner and extended it to bring her head less than two centimeters from his.</p>
<p>Nicholas saw his own reflection in her eyes, face terrified and somewhat aroused. At that moment, he realised felt more excitement than fear. The thrill of exorcism, a dance with the demon would be exhilarating. With a tinge of guilt, he awaited the embrace of the creature with bated breath.</p>
<p>Soft lips met his. Her serpent tongue licked, tasted and explored his lips before finally slipping in. A disgusting sensation of salt and dread assaulted him and he immediately tried to push her away. But she forced herself in and deposited a round orb down his throat.</p>
<p>Nicholas retched and tried to vomit out the orb as well as the taste of salt but it was to no avail. His vision grew fuzzy and he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>"A gift for you."</p>
<p>She whispered before disappearing. She left no trace behind, not even the fried chicken she promised him.</p>
<p>Nicholas woke up at the beach. Violet waves broke gently into white foam against the soft golden sand. Along the shore, a small ghost crab was struggling against the breeze. Realising that it was spotted, it quickly burrowed itself in the sand. Nicholas chuckled as it reminded him of his plight earlier.</p>
<p>"Oh you are awake."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-11-the-rescue">Chapter 11: The Rescue</h2>
<p>Chanel headed down the ship's main corridor. At this time of night it was usually quiet, but there was now a flurry of activity as the ship's crew prepared the diving capsule. She headed purposefully toward the well dock area, her feet scurrying hurriedly.</p>
<p>"I've ordered Jonathan, our midshipman man, to take the craft down. You can wait up here and monitor progress over the videolink," Jemma advised over her in-ear monitor.</p>
<p>"That will be unnecessary. Chanel will conduct the mission herself. Jonathan can be the XO Prepare for launch," she said, changing into a tight, body fitting wetsuit.</p>
<p>The solitary craft sat in middle of the well dock, the ASPACEW logo slowly beginning to be covered by water as flooding began. Chanel lowered herself into the hatch, familiarizing herself with the controls. She thought back to the last time she had played a diving simulation with her friend - that was just last year, at a carnival in a park, on an old PC, and she beat him. She smiled with the recollection of that memory.</p>
<p>Chanel expertly guided the craft through the alien formations underwater, tracing Nicholas' distress beacon to the cave system. The craft surfaced into a large underwater cavern with a small sand shore. A single passageway led deeper. Two pairs of footprints marked the way, one pair being of boots while the other was webbed like that of a duck's.</p>
<p>She glanced at her wristwatch - the distress beacon was only fifty meters ahead. She stepped gingerly through the narrow passageway, her footsteps echoing off the walls and deeper down the cave. It was eerily quiet as she ventured deeper through the twists and turns, the sound of the waves outside was no longer audible after just a few meters into the passageway. The passageway itself was illuminated by a dull, violet glow from numerous glowing crystals on the walls.</p>
<p>10 meters. She was getting close now. Glancing at the floor, she realized the webbed footprints had disappeared. Curiously, in their place were the stiletto marks of high heeled shoes.</p>
<p>As she made a sharp right bend in front, she gasped and almost stopped in shock.</p>
<p>Just a few meters from her, in a natural crevasse of the rock, was a humanoid figure in a seated position, the upper half leaning on the the cavern walls. Most of the body was covered in a fine, sticky white thread resembling a cocoon, with only the figure's head free.</p>
<p>Nicholas! Chanel's motherly instincts shook her free from her shock and she went over to cooconed victim. She felt his pulse - it was still there, but weak. To her relief, he was still breathing, in slow, shallow breaths. She held his face in her hands and shook him.</p>
<p>"Nicholas? Nicholas? Wake up!"</p>
<p>His eyes remained closed, his head falling limply in her hands.</p>
<p><em>No, no, no, it can't be! Why did he risk his life doing such a dangerous thing!</em> Her eyes welled up with tears, and to her surprise, she leant on him, cradling his soft hair and feeling what was left of his bodily warmth.</p>
<p>Despite her grief, she took out her penknife and began cutting him free, resolving to take him out of this forsaken cave, which was now becoming eerily colder.</p>
<p>She felt drops of cold water dripping on her neck.</p>
<p>"Chanel, Chanel, Chanel." A distinctively familiar, yet reptilian sounding voice hissed from above her.</p>
<p>Above her, on a ledge, her previous XO was crouched, a pair of webbed fingers holding the edge of the rock. A pair of soulless black eyes fixed her.</p>
<p>Her hand immediately went to her gun holster.</p>
<p>"Trying to save him? Don't bother, in a few hours he'll become one of us."</p>
<p>"What are you?"</p>
<p>"Why, your successors, of course. It was a mistake of your kind to set foot on this planet. Humans are so easy to tempt, slaves of their desires. Nicholas fell so easily. Oh, I thought you might be interested to know - he gets really excited about you," her XO taunted her. "And by the way, he tastes really nice," she smiled gloatingly, licking her lips.</p>
<p>"Just die!" Chanel screamed, firing her laser pistol. The creature was surprisingly quick, dodging her shots, disappearing into the blackness of the cave ledge ahead.</p>
<p>Chanel set back on freeing Nicholas, all the while keeping her ears pricked for any signs of the creature. She completed her task uninterrupted, and then began to drag him back to the craft.</p>
<p><em>He was heavy!</em> She exerted herself, panting as she dragged him by his arms.</p>
<p>The craft was still waiting by the sandy shore of the cave. Glancing back, she saw just the dim violet lighting of the cave. No sign of the creature. She loaded him into the craft, closed the hatch and sped out of the cave.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-12-being-late-can-be-a-good-thing">Chapter 12: Being late can be a good thing</h2>
<p>Nicholas turned his head to face the familiar voice.</p>
<p>"Why did you go -" Chanel cut herself off in surprise, as she looked at his features. <em>His eyes - the whites had become grey!</em></p>
<p>She quickly recounted his rescue, omitting her emotions about him.</p>
<p>"We need to get you back to the medical bay asap. There could be some sort of parasite inside you, if we are to trust the creature," she advised him. "I couldn't go back to the shop directly - there's not enough fuel. I've signalled to the ship and they'll reach us in half an hour."</p>
<p>She abruptly raised her voice. "Why did you go to the temple?? Why didn't you listen to my guidance?? Why do you keep disobeying authority??" She was so angry, her eyes began to puff up with tears.</p>
<p>"I...Tricia... That creature, it gave me two options...I chose the more exciting one," he said sheepishly.</p>
<p>"It knows you like adventure, it wasn't even a choice to begin with! I risked my life to get you back from there!"</p>
<p>"I'm... I'm sorry," he looked down at the sand. Abruptly, he began coughing, clutching his chest.</p>
<p>Chanel's expression of frustration changed to one of worry and concern. She wiped her tears and softened her voice.</p>
<p>"The ship will be here soon, we will fix you up then. In the mean time, let's get you some food, it will make you feel better."</p>
<p>She stood up and walked towards the small stove behind her. When she lifted the copper lid, hot steam bursted out and filled the air with the aroma of chinese herbs and chicken. The steam floated up 5 metres before hitting a barrier of sorts. It bounced back gently before continuing its journey to the sky. Round metal domes placed at four corners of the perimeter generated a circular force field of supercharged plasma.</p>
<p>She filled two bowls with piping hot nutritious soup and handed one to him. They sat by the shore and ate quietly as they watch the sun setting in the horizon. He missed the crimson orange sun. While the purple was ethereal and beautiful, it brought melancholy instead of warmth.</p>
<p>"I don't know what will become of me. I don't feel different now but I think its a matter of time before I won't remember who I am."</p>
<p>Uncertain of how to reply, Chanel reached for his hand. Absentmindedly, she traced the outlines of his hand.</p>
<p>Like every other night, once the moon rises and the stars reveal themselves, violet petals will begin their descend down the sky. The sound of the waves washing against the shore became more prominent and so did her presence next to him.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the cold sea breeze. Perhaps it was the loneliness and deprivation of intimacy in this foreign land. Perhaps it was mutual attraction. Within their protective bubble, under the falling snow petals, the two people held each other as they waited for the ship to arrive.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-13-is-it-cancer">Chapter 13: Is it cancer?</h2>
<p>Late by two and half hours, Jonathan finally picked them up and brought them back to ship. Chanel was not sure whether she was glad to be back. At the medical bay, Nicholas laid under the omniscanner once more.</p>
<p>Chanel keyed in the initiation sequence. Nicholas' eyes were closed, his breathing calm. If he was nervous, it wasn't apparent to her.</p>
<p>The air smelled faintly of ozone as the scanner energized, firing a beam of neutrinos through his body. A blue glow filled the room as the holographic projector materialized a 3D translucent replica of his body a few inches above him. A red rectangle appeared and sliced through the hologram from head to toe as the scan progressed.</p>
<p>"Neutrino phase complete. Brief screening indicates no anomaly detected. Progressing to full spectrum scan," Jemma announced overhead.</p>
<p><em>Full spectrum?</em> The last patient who required that was many years back, a young boy with a rare leukemia which even the medical team on board couldn't identify with their blood tests. A full spectrum scan involved passing multiple frequencies of electromagnetic waves through the body. It was time consuming, costly and and was rarely ever indicated.</p>
<p>The holographic projection continued it's animation with successive rectangles in various colors, indicating different wavelengths of each scan.</p>
<p>"Chief Scientist Chanel. Report to the bridge immediately. Chief Scientist Chanel," the PA blared abruptly.</p>
<p>As she walked out of the medical bay, she turned and gave the scanner a final glance. Nicholas was still lying motionless as the hologram progressed through its multicolor display. There was no indication of anything wrong.</p>
<p>In his mind, it was anything but quiet.</p>
<p>He was standing by the railing of a canal, a familiar-looking one he recognized from childhood. It was in the middle of the afternoon. He was looking at the opposite bank when a hand tapped his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Help me," A middle aged man pleaded, clutching his chest and wheezing. His eyes were completely black, and so were the visible veins of his hand, resembling a black spiderweb.</p>
<p>"Please, mister, help me," Another person on his left tugged at his shirt, a middle aged lady, her eyes similarly black. Her breathing was punctuated with bouts of coughing.</p>
<p>He saw relatives, his friends, all in similar plights, their bodies wracked with the same sickness. In the crowd of people he saw his medical school friends, his dragonboat teammates.</p>
<p>"Nicholas," a familiar voice rasped. He turned to face the owner. It was Chanel, her white uniform in tatters, her face streaked with blood, her eyes completely black. "Impossible," he mumbled in shock, shaking his head as his vision darkened.</p>
<p>He woke up with a start, his pulse racing, his body lightly drenched with sweat. The room was silent, and he was alone. He looked at his arms - apart from some red scratches, they appeared fine.</p>
<p>He threw off the blanket, changed into a pair of scrubs and looked for a mirror. His attention wondered to a large display at the opposite end of the room.</p>
<p>"Patient name: Nicholas Leong," it read. "Xenon integration with DNA: 99.98%. Scan result: Unknown DNA detected. Critical sequences overwritten. Incompatible with life."</p>
<p>His gaze narrowed as he read the last line of emotionless text.</p>
<p>"Probability of cure: 0%. Estimated survival: 3 days."</p>
<p>He shook his head slowly, let out a sigh and left the room.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-14-of-shy-boys-and-cute-girls">Chapter 14: Of shy boys and cute girls</h2>
<p>"I think we should have some lilies, an oriental feel would be in line with our roots," Vice Admiral Zhang offered.</p>
<p>"No, simple flowers like roses would fit the occasion better. Don't forget we're having international guests," XO Jonathan replied.</p>
<p>"This is a safety conference we're organizing, not Valentine's day. Besides, how are roses 'simple'? We're going to blow the budget at this rate," another official quipped.</p>
<p>Chanel looked at her watch impatiently. <em>What am I doing here?</em> It was an hour already and the committee was still on the first item of the agenda.</p>
<p>Her mind wandered off to Nicholas. She made an excuse to go to the restroom and left the officials, who were now proposing using Jemma to choose flowers.</p>
<p>She walked down the starboard side of the ship, admiring the night time view of the Xenon petals falling. Directly in front, she could make out the silhouette of someone leaning on the railing, similarly looking at the sea.</p>
<p>"Nicholas?"</p>
<p>He turned to face her, his face still recognizable in the dim light.</p>
<p>"Oh, hi." He gave her a weak smile and turned back to looking at the sea. His usual enthusiasm seemed to have evaporated.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking?"</p>
<p>"Nah, nothing. I'm fine," he lied unconvincingly.</p>
<p>The waves, glowing a faint violet, splashed gently on the side of the ship. Ahead, the M22 galaxy was rising on the horizon, its twin spiral arms cradling a yellowish galactic core. In the background were the faint blue and yellow gas clouds of the Orion nebula. The scene reminded her of the view she had from mountain hotel in France, back on Earth.</p>
<p>They both kept silent for a while, looking at the view. To Chanel, the lie was obvious.</p>
<p>"Hey, you can tell me what's going on. I'll do my best to help," she offered. "You can trust me, I won't tell anyone. "</p>
<p>He sighed deeply and told her what he saw on the scanner display.</p>
<p>Her heart sank when she heard the news.</p>
<p>"Maybe there's an error. Maybe the scanner doesn't know how to interpret the result. Maybe..." Her voice trailed off as she thought about the implications, hoping her expression didn't betray her.</p>
<p>He shifted his grip on the railing, still looking out to sea.</p>
<p>"Look, Chanel. Three weeks ago, before they called me to come here, I was at a mid life crisis. I was a doctor on Earth, but honestly, I hate medicine. I don't know what I'm working for - I don't feel fulfilled, and the night duties drain my soul. I'd much rather write a trading bot or something."</p>
<p>He turned to face her.</p>
<p>"And then they called me to come here. I don't have my family, internet, heck, I can't access the powerful server I made myself here. I'm just rotting away intellectually. And now this - I give in to my desires for just one second and the next moment, I... I find out I'm going to die. Why??" He was on the verge of crying, his voice wavering.</p>
<p>"I can't say I can empathize with you but..." Her throat dried up. She stared into his eyes, searching for what to say.</p>
<p>He broke off eye contact and looked down at the floor, at her feet, his hands letting go of the railing.</p>
<p>"Hug me," he said.</p>
<p>Those two words pulled at her heart strings and she pulled him towards her. She felt his body tense up on her initial touch before easing into her arms. He cautiously wrapped his arms around her waist over her tight wetsuit, closing the little gap between them.</p>
<p>He was much taller than her so she could only lay her head on his chest. She could hear the sound of his heartbeat and feel its warmth radiating from him. She remembered when she first saw him, lost and unconscious at the medical bay. She had to resist the urge to touch him in his sleep but now he is willingly in her arms. A moment of vulnerability turned into a moment of connection.</p>
<p>"Are you feeling better?"</p>
<p>"Yeah haha um I don't smell, do I? I haven't showered for 2 days.."</p>
<p>She giggled at his unnecessary concern before being reminded of the bigger problem at hand.</p>
<p>"We can hug whenever and whereever. But let's get you back to the lab, I want to get blood samples and analyse the scan results in detail. I won't let you die... there is definitely a cure to be found. "</p>
<h2 id="chapter-15-yup-its-cancer">Chapter 15: Yup, its cancer</h2>
<p>Taking his hand in hers, Chanel led him back to the medical lab. She took out some bottles, a syringe and a needle out of the sterilizer. Not missing the chance to feel his toned biceps, she wrapped a rubber strap tightly around it to find his obvious vein. After cleaning the skin around the underside of his elbow with an alcohol wipe, she inserted a small needle into the vein and filled three bottles with blood.</p>
<p>She dropped two bottles into the 360 Quad Coagulation Analyzer and started it before pulling out the full spectrum scan results. Nicholas slid his chair next to her and they looked at the detailed report together.</p>
<p>A virtual four dimensional interactive diagram of Nicholas' DNA sequencing was generated. Two large linked strands wound around each other like a twisted ladder, forming a double helix. Black unknown compounds latched themselves on the ladders. The blood analysis was also completed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Glucose - 4.8 mmol/L
Triglycerides - 0.39 mmol/L
Luteinizing hormone (LH) - 7.2 IU/L
Iron - 23 ug/mL
Iron Saturation - 2.23% **CRITICAL
</code></pre></div>
<p>Nicholas' heart skipped a beat, but to his own surprise, maintained his composure.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's due to my menses," he offered, grinning.</p>
<p>"Oh seriously, that's ridiculous," she rebutted, resisting a sudden urge to pinch his cheeks in response.</p>
<p>"You could be having an infection," she said, simultaneously wondering if that was more to distract herself than to explain.</p>
<p>"Sometimes in infections, the body's cells take in iron, and that prevents the invading bacteria from having sufficient iron for their replication. I guess I could start you on an antibiotic or something."</p>
<p>She had put on her spectacles, a petite black rimmed pair, which rested on the tip of her button nose. Coupled with her cheerful, engaged tone of voice, he thought she resembled the stereotype of a hardworking student. More naughtily he thought to himself, <em>perhaps she's one with talents not just confined to the classroom.</em> He caught himself staring at her and cleared his throat abruptly, looking away.</p>
<p>"Well um, I think I'm feeling better already actually. I might just need a bit of rest and then I'll be back in action."</p>
<p>"See you again!" He waved as he left.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-16-becoming-less-of-a-man">Chapter 16: Becoming less of a man</h2>
<p>The bunk was empty when he entered, the beds neatly bed. Usually at this hour, close to bedtime, card games would be in progress, and washing would be going on. He spared no further thought as he undressed and went to the shower.</p>
<p>He made a quick glance at the mirror, his usual routine. In much the same way a gardener returning home would glance over at their crops to review their progress, Nicholas liked to check his dental work in the mirror. This time, however, he paused in astonishment.</p>
<p>His tongue. Something was off about it.</p>
<p>He stopped at the mirror, and gaped his mouth at it, looking closely at his tongue.</p>
<p>The tip of his tongue had already bifurcated into two, like that of a serpent's. There was a deep furrow forming down the rest of his tongue.</p>
<p>His gaze wandered slowly upwards, and he caught his breath in shock.</p>
<p>Both his eyes were black as night.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-17-trespassing-is-illegal">Chapter 17: Trespassing is illegal</h2>
<p>The black orbs hung onto the handles of the twisted ladder as it twirled in the middle of the white medical lab. Chanel was engrossed in inspecting a specimen under the EXC-9000 microscope.</p>
<p>Her patient's abrupt self-declared departure was even more ridiculous than his personal menses diagnosis. It was usually the doctor who decides when the consultation ends. Did he not know how valuable her time was? How could he just leave like that? She grumbled for a good amount before reasoning that he was probably tired from his ordeal and body changes.</p>
<p>She had extracted a drop of blood from the remaining bottle and prepared a blood smear for analysis. Peering into the microscope's ocular lens, a splatter of reddish pills came into view. As she rotated the knob, the image grew larger. His red blood cells was mutated, transformed into an odd hourglass shape. She had never seen anything like this.</p>
<p>Chanel spent hours burrowing her head into the microscope and studying journals that could explain the peculiar genetic mutation. However, it appears that the scientific knowledge available in this era will not be able to provide a definite answer to this phenomenon.</p>
<p>At the verge of calling it a night, she suddenly recalled her ex-XO Tricia being sick and isolating herself in her room for 5 days, refusing to receive any treatment or examination after one of her deep dive missions. She must have undergone the same transformation! There must be some clue there!</p>
<p>When the moon is in its full bloom, Chanel sneaked into one of the cabins along the narrow corridor. Tricia's cabin was empty. Her single-sized bed that occupied three quarters of the room was soaked wet by the waves intruding from the unclosed window. A small desk at the corner held a mirror, some cosmetics and her signature black nail polish. Below the desk, safe from the elements, laid a stack of documents and journals.</p>
<p>She squatted down to examine the pile of papers. The looser sheets fluttered in the salty night breeze. A large, bold title was printed on the topmost sheet. <em>5KM in 10 Weeks - Results Guaranteed</em>. The next few papers and journals were on a similar theme - <em>Lose 10 Pounds in 10 Days</em>, <em>An Experimental Determination of the Relationship between Belly Fat and Perceived Facial Cuteness</em>. Chanel absentmindedly put them aside without further thought, wondering what Tricia's obsession with weight loss was about, and why she was into such trashy material - being an XO on board such a mission demanded scientific rigor, and these articles were bottom of the barrel material.</p>
<p>Quite satisfied that there were no clues to be found, she restored the stack of papers to their original position. Just as she was nearing completion, she accidentally knocked loose a journal in a critical position, making the entire pile of papers fall. She impatiently let out a sigh and prepared to redo the stack - but stared at something in the bottom of the pile.</p>
<p>A rectangular hole had been cut haphazardly in the last few journals and papers, forming a recess of sorts. From the outside, it was invisible. No one would have suspected there to be anything hidden in the innocuous looking stack of papers. That explains the choice of titles, Chanel surmised.</p>
<p>Inside this recess lay a pocket sized brown, leather notebook with worn edges. Beside the notebook was a small transparent crystal, with jagged edges, as if roughly cut from a larger piece. As she gazed at it, there seemed to be very faint, almost indistinguishable flashes of color within it - a tinge of red, which as she stared, slowly morphed to green.</p>
<p>It was then she realized how quiet the cabin had become. The sound of the waves had stopped, and the room was deathly silent. It was as if someone had tuned out the whole world beyond the cabin. Even the sound of the wind blowing through the curtains had stopped. She could hear her own breathing beginning to quicken as a jolt of fear swept through her.</p>
<p>She became painfully aware that she was alone, and unarmed.</p>
<p><em>Clunk. Clunk.</em> The sound seemed to be emanating from somewhere outside, below the cabin window. It sounded like a hard material, perhaps boots or shoes, banging against the cabin window. The cabin she was in was at least 20 meters above sea level, and there were no steps or ledges of any kind outside the ship hull.</p>
<p><em>Clunk, clunk.</em> The sound was getting closer. Ledges or not, whatever was out there was almost at the level of the window.</p>
<p>Her heart was pounding as she snuck under the table and curled herself up, trying to force her tiny body into the narrow gap between the table legs and the pile of documents. The window was just above her, separated by the 5 or so centimeters of the table top.</p>
<p>Just then, she heard the curtains move, and she knew it was not the wind.</p>
<p><em>CLUNK!</em></p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../../static/stories/cube.jpg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="../../static/stories/cube.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A metal cube and its chain dropped to the floor in front of her. Chanel nearly squealed in fright but she managed to suppress her voice.</p>
<p>Two slender legs appeared in her view. She clasped her sweaty palms closer over her mouth and held her breath. The momentary silence felt like an eternity as she prayed for the stranger to leave. Unfortunately, her faced paled when she heard the words that broke the silence.</p>
<p>"There seems to be a rat in my room."</p>
<p>It was Tricia's voice. Slowly but surely, she approached the table and bent over to reveal her familiar smirking face to Chanel.</p>
<p>"My my my... why isn't it my boss Chanel?"</p>
<p>Tricia's black orbs scanned over to the messed up pile of journals and paper. She pursed her lips when she saw that her notebook and crystal was laid out in the open.</p>
<p>As she spoke, she slithered her dripping wet body next to girl under the table, separating her from her treasures. Fully aware of her every movement, Chanel froze in fear.</p>
<p>"It seems that you have found out that I have obesophobia. You probably didn't know that I used to be obese. Those were the darkest period of my life. I would starve myself for days and listen to all the mockery and belittling from my family and schoolmates. But you? How could you understand? You probably lived all your life without worry. Can you even understand? Do you even know what is going on?"</p>
<p>Taking her time, Tricia picked up the notebook and crystal and stared at them in contemplation before whispering softly into the chief scientist's ear, sending chills down her spine.</p>
<p>"Do you want to know what is going on?"</p>
<p>Chanel winced and withdrew further into the recess as an acrid sour smell hit her. Her ex-subordinate let out a laugh, leaned back and flung the metal cube onto the floor, leaving a visible dent.</p>
<p>“Humans, humans, humans. How fragile, so dependent on shelter, food, and the most ridiculous concept of all – romance.”</p>
<p>“Dedicating your life to one person, who will probably end up disappointing you. And you humans – always putting your own needs before anything else,” she taunted.</p>
<p>“Don’t you enjoy being slaves to your own bodies? Consumed by your own needs and desires? You are all slaves. Useless, aimless slaves.”</p>
<p>She leaned closer, a broad grin on her face, her forked tongue visible. The reflection of the rising moon glinted off the metal cube and chains.</p>
<p>“I’ll let you into something. I used to be so jealous of you. Yes, really! Don’t act like you didn’t know. How you maintained your slim figure, while eating all that fried food on board the ship. I was so, so envious. Consumed by envy, a burning, fiery pit in me, destroying me bit by bit each day, like a cancer growing in me.”</p>
<p>“But then, something happened. Call it a blessing, or opportunity, whatever. I was shown the way, given a gift. I saw true freedom, freedom from my desires, from my useless body. And I willingly gave my body to them, like a spare part. I dropped my weaknesses, my humanity, my fragility, and embraced unbounded freedom.”</p>
<p>Tricia rose up, causing water to trickle down her slender legs, which were covered in a hard, scaly exterior, almost reptilian in nature. She stepped toward Chanel, squatted in front of her, and stared at her.</p>
<p>“Now my child, join me. Free yourself from your humanity.”</p>
<p>She opened her mouth, and extended her forked tongue towards her. On the tip of her tongue was a small round orb, the size of a large grape. It had a soft, translucent exterior, almost jelly-like, and within it, swimming within its pod, was a pea-sized flat creature resembling a fluke.</p>
<p>Chanel reeled back with disgust and fear. <em>A worm inside her? No no no, she thought.</em> Turning her head away, she pushed against Tricia with her arms, expecting resistance.</p>
<p>To her surprise, Tricia retracted her tongue and swallowed the orb.</p>
<p>“Disgust. Fear. Just look at your body, controlling you like that. No matter. You will soon willingly join us, and ingest the host, like we have all done. Oh, you will not just accept it, you will be begging for it, craving for it, like the little slave girl you are. Already you are a slave to your emotions, and soon, your body will feed us, and join the greater union.”</p>
<p><em>What a bitch</em>, thought Chanel, feeling an impulse to punch the creature in front of her. She clenched and flexed her knuckles, preparing to strike.</p>
<p>“Oh no, you don’t get to do that.”</p>
<p>Alas, she was too slow, her subtle movements noticed by Tricia. Tricia reached out with inhuman speed and closed her fingers around Chanel’s neck, choking her with brute strength. Chanel’s eyes began to water as she fought back and struggled to breath, attempting to pry the webbed fingers. Her strength was no match for that of the creature, however. As she struggled, her vision began to narrow and darken, as Tricia tightened her grip, cutting off the blood supply to the brain.</p>
<p><em>I have to tell Nicholas,</em> thought Chanel, as her consciousness began to fade. The last thing she saw was the metal cube, glowing white and floating in mid air.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-18-there-are-worse-things-than-cancer">Chapter 18: There are worse things than cancer</h2>
<p>Wide awake and alone in his bunk, Nicholas let his mind wander freely.</p>
<p><em>Where is everyone?</em> It was past midnight and he had the entire 12 bunk room to himself. <em>Did they know he was infected?</em> But the communications at Department of Extrasolar Analysis and Defense was horrendous - both the virtual and physical communications. Despite the advanced technology, connection to the world wide web and sharing of information was restricted for security reasons. Nicholas doubts anyone knows his plight.</p>
<p>Back at the toilet, he was startled by his alien appearance. After doing a double take, he was back to his human self. It was then he realised he was able to change his form at will. He flexed his webbed hand and morphed it back and forth in fascination.</p>
<p><em>Will he die like what was predicted by that bogus machine?</em> He was perfectly healthy and perhaps even more so. <em>Three days?</em> It can't be that accurate. If anything, it would be him that decides his fate.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and listened to the waves and the gentle merging of the petals into the waves. The soft pats grew into a light pitter-patter as the petals solidify with the freezing temperatures of the moonlight. The air was cool and Nicholas was pleased to have some alone time in the mundane of civilization for once.</p>
<p>He was about to fall asleep when the sound of clunking metal disturbed the melody of the icicle petals. At first, he thought it was the wind that blew some metal crates but the clunking continued on at a regular pace. It could be the engineer fixing some pipes at the boiler room but somehow he knew better. His senses or newly gained senses told him that his kind is nearby.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-19-big-ship-hunts-down-small-man">Chapter 19: Big ship hunts down small man</h2>
<p>Vice Admiral Kathy Liu stared with glazed eyes at the scene in front of her. The cruiser had been in low orbit for the last 5 days. From her position on the bridge, the gentle curvature of the blue-green exoplanet was apparent, with a speckle of light emanating from one of the larger land masses, a solitary bright light in the otherwise dark side of the planet. This was the landing zone, lit up at night by fusion torches, themselves powered by portable QFGs - Quantum Field Generators, a smaller version of the drives which powered the very cruiser she was on. The developments in quantum tech in the 21st century had enabled humanity to tap an infinite source of energy, albeit at a limited rate, using these devices. The same developments also brought about interstellar travel, powered by deeper knowledge about the very fabric of space-time itself, and the ability to tear precise 'holes' in this fabric, colloquially known as warping. The operation of these QFGs was so complex that no single human understood their operation entirely. In the recent years since the discovery of Xenon Earth and unique ability to enhance supercomputing, the task of operating and maintaining them was therefore left almost entirely to various artificial intelligence constructs.</p>
<p>She stifled a yawn and glanced at her wristwatch. It had been hours since the last landing party had reported back their last readings of the atmosphere. The record showed that the level of Xenon nanoparticles had been increasing in the atmosphere steadily over the last few hours.</p>
<p>A polite knock on her door interrupted her reverie. The onboard lab tech, Ginny or Gin for short, stood patiently at the entrance, holding a tablet in one hand. He wore a white lab coat, emblazoned with the DEAD logo on the lapel. His other hand adjusted the thick black rim of his spectacles, in a gesture of deference.</p>
<p>"Ma'am, apologies for the disturbance. We've just gotten the report on the test subject from the lab. Would you like a look?"</p>
<p>"I'll look through them myself, thank you. You may leave," she said curtly.</p>
<p>Kathy examined the report. "Test Subject A003 - Male, 29," it began. "Weight: 68kg. Height: 170cm."</p>
<p>She thumbed down on the screen mechanically, until she saw a line which made her stop abruptly.</p>
<p>"DNA mutations detected. Probability of infection: 99.95%, 95% CI 0.9995-1.0"</p>
<p>Despite not having a strong background in applied statistics, the figures stood out clearly to her. He was infected with Cerulean spores, and would soon convert. She took in a deep breath and let out an equally loud sigh.</p>
<p>"Find him," she ordered.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-20-lost-and-found">Chapter 20: Lost and found</h2>
<p>The sound of metal hitting against metal grew louder and louder, until it stopped abruptly somewhere behind him. Nicholas spun around.</p>
<p>The deck was empty. He was alone. One of the lights along the passageway leading to the ship's lift flickered. The sea breeze seemed to have disappeared, leaving the sound of the waves lashing against the ship's hull. There was an unnatural quietness to the scene, made even more pronounced by the abrupt disappearance of the clanging sound. The source was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>He felt an inner desire within him, beckoning him towards the passageway. It was as if he knew he had to go there, that something would be waiting for him there. <em>This is illogical</em>, he thought. But his feet betrayed him, and he headed toward the passageway.</p>
<p>The lift was waiting for him, both doors open. He went in and hit the button for his cabin floor, in the basement. The lift doors closed soundlessly, and the familiar whine of the elevator motor began. He leaned back against the walls of the elevator, an action learnt out of habit.</p>
<p>Abruptly, the elevator jerked, and came to a halt. The floor indicators for both the ground level and the basement level were both lit up simultaneously. Strangely, the lift doors remained closed. A lift malfunction? He reached out and prepared to press the emergency bell, but before he could do so, the elevator lights went out. He was in darkness.</p>
<p>At this moment, he began to have the strangest sensation - that someone, or something, was in the elevator with him, at this very moment, against all logic. Fear gripped him, as his senses became hyper-acute, amplifying his breathing. His pulse quickened as he stared out hard against the gloom in front of him.</p>
<p>He became absolutely certain that someone, or something, was between him and the elevator doors.</p>
<p>He began reaching his hand out, trying to grope, to feel whatever it was. As he reached forward, he felt an icy draft caress his fingertips, making him shiver involuntarily.</p>
<p>The elevator lights turned on without warning, and he jumped back in shock.</p>
<p>Tricia was standing in front of him.</p>
<p>"Did you miss me?"</p>
<p>Nicholas was not surprised that she would come looking for him. He was also looking for her for answers.</p>
<p>"Have you come to take me away?" He was amazed to find himself not filled with rage in front of creature who had cursed and corrupted his life. In front of her, he was unexpectedly calm and mostly curious.</p>
<p>"You are a smart man. Let's make things easy for both of us. I am sure you want to know where you truly belong?"</p>
<p>"How about Chanel?"</p>
<p>"You live in different worlds now. There is no need to concern yourself with her. She will be fine here but unfortunately or fortunately for you, the transformation has began. For a complete transformation, you will have to drink the water of the Cerulean Soto Temple or else you will die. "</p>
<p>"The tides will change when the sun rises. If you want to enter the Cerulean Soto Temple, you must go now. The next opening will be the June solstice and I cannot promise that you or me will still be here. "</p>
<p>Nicholas thought for a moment. He knew he had no choice. He has felt the calling to the temple through his veins and bones. It beckons and coaxes him to fulfil his or its need and he needs to find out more.</p>
<p>The lift doors opened and the two figures walked out. One following the other to the edge of the ship deck. The feminine leader grew out a lizard-like tail and encouraged the male behind to follow suit. Quick to adapt, both of them dived into the dark ocean.</p>
<p>Chanel found herself standing on the top of a barren sand dune, overlooking a vast desert. The view was breathtaking, and the immensity of the land contrasted with its emptiness, for she was alone here, with brown sand stretching for miles in every direction. No birds in the distance, insects, or even a patch of green was to be seen.</p>
<p>She looked downward, and found herself wearing a white tunic, torn and tattered in various locations. She bent down and scooped a handful of sand - it was extremely fine, and fell between her fingers. The entire landscape was soundless - so quiet in fact, that she could hear the sounds of the falling sand. </p>
<p><em>What is this place,</em> she wondered. It seemed ethereal, even magical. In the dim recesses of her mind, she could not recall seeing any place like that on Earth.</p>
<p>A distant movement in the horizon caught her attention. There seemed to be a line of approaching humanoid figures - very distant, but in immense numbers, for they spanned the entire horizon, left to right, as far as she could see. She continued to watch, and saw that they were people, dressed in various clothings, running toward her. As they closed, she could see their features more clearly, and they seemed expressionless, emotionless, yet running toward her with supernatural urgency. She looked around her - they were approaching from all directions.</p>
<p>When the closest of them was about a hundred meters away from her, all of them abruptly stopped running, and stood there, staring at her. Strangely, she did not feel threatened - but rather a sense of sorrow and sadness overpowered her. She looked at their faces - Nicholas! He was there, looking blankly at her. His usual vigour and vitality seemed to have disappeared.</p>
<p>The group of people around her continued to stare, and then one of the men she didn't recognize opened his mouth, stretching wide almost painfully. It seemed like an accidental gesture, like a yawn, but she felt compelled to stare, looking at his teeth and the void of his pharynx beyond. It seemed so dark, and as she continued to watch she could see the darkness spread across over his teeth, like a single tendril. No, not a tendril - it was his tongue. It was completely black, and serpent-like, forked at the tip.</p>
<p>Then she heard a chorus of moans, and saw that the rest of the people were doing the same gesture, their forked tongues flitting at the air, like a mass of serpents.</p>
<p>"Help us," they pleaded with her, "free us from this torment..."</p>
<p>She was surrounded, with nowhere to go. As they closed around her, surrounding her with the same inky darkness she had seen in their mouths, her vision blacked out.</p>
<p>Chanel sat up with a start, sweating. It was still night. The cool sea air was blowing through the curtains, and on the floor there were scratches. Slowly, her memories came back to her. The cube. The struggle. Tricia. And Nicholas!</p>
<p>Just then, her phone buzzed. It was Gin, the lab tech aboard the space cruiser Morning Dew, and her ex-colleague, who had since moved on to greater heights, literally, working in the cruiser.</p>
<p><em>Hey, Gin here. Hope you're enjoying yourself with the research on Xenon microparticles here. It's kinda boring on the cruiser, maybe I should have stayed with the Naval department of DEAD instead. Anyway, I need your help - we're trying to locate a mutant. DNA looks messed up, not sure how this is even possible. Meet me on the ship when you can?</em></p>
